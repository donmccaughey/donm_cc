.page links Business Novels

Business writing is full of story telling.  Authors try to hook you with a case
study or anecdote (often anonymized or fictionalized) that demonstrates how
their technique or framework lead the protagonist to business success.  The
boring abstract discussion follows.  A few authors have turned the story part
up to eleven and produced full-fledged <em>business novels</em>.  The writing
is sometimes amateurish and uneven, but I find this genre particularly fun.
