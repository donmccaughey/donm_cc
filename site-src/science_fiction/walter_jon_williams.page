The <strong>Dread Empire's Fall</strong> series is conventional military space
opera with all the tropes: space battles in a star-spanning empire dominated by
noble families with far-too-clever protagonists who succeed spectacularly
despite overwhelming odds against them.  Williams takes us on a fun stroll down
this well-trodden path.
