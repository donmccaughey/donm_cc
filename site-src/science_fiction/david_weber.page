.page author David Weber

Weber is _not_ a great writer.  His stories are _very_ conventional military
space opera written with a limited palette: the good guys are truly good and
the hero always triumphs in the end due to her physical, mental and _moral_
superiority.  Given this, Weber frequently delivers a well-paced plot that
leads to a satisfyingly schmaltzy denouement.


.section links Honor Harrington

This is a colossal "series of series" listed below in publication order.  It
starts off as _Horatio Hornblower_ in space, following the naval career of
Honor Harrington as she assumes command of her first starship.  I particularly
enjoyed the development and evolution of the naval starship technology in the
early novels.  Later books get caught up in the politics of clashing space
empires and Weber too frequently falls into telling us about events rather than
showing us.  Still, if you're willing to slog through, there's usually a
satisfying space battle near the end of each book.

The main Honor Harrington series spawns two other contemporary story lines and
two prequel series.  The Wikipedia article on the 
[Honorverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorverse#Honor_Harrington_series)
breaks it all down.

.section links Empire of Man

Another conventional military space opera where the heir to a galactic empire
is stranded and has to make his way across an alien planet to the world's only
starport.  Aside from the plot revolving around a point often lost in space
opera (planets are _big_!), this is "comfort food" science fiction: never
surprising or challenging but satisfying nonetheless.
