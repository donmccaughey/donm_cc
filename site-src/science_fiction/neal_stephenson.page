.page author Neal Stephenson

Stephenson is a geek.  And he writes about geeks.  His books often take wild
turns, and he sometimes loses control of his story.  You won't find a
cardboard 19th century hero swashbuckling his way across the galaxy to save the
day and win the girl, but rather smart, curious people fascinated by the world
around them as the universe throws them a curveball.

_Snow Crash_, probably his best known book, is a dystopian satire of 1990's
America that coined the term _metaverse_.  My personal favorites are
_Cryptonomicon_, with it's parallel World War II and present-day storylines, and
the three volume / eight book _Baroque Cycle_, an historical novel set in the
Enlightenment that's still somehow science fiction.

.section links The Baroque Cycle

Originally published as three hardcover volumes each around 900 pages long and
later as eight paperbacks, _The Baroque Cycle_ is one very long novel set in the
late 1600s to early 1700s, centered in Europe but spanning the world.  It's an
historical novel about the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution, but,
_somehow_, it's also a science fiction novel about a society in transition,
economics and the nature of knowledge.  I eagerly dove into each volume as it
was published.  It's a _very_ long story, and after spending so many delightful
hours in this strange and wonderful world, I felt sad when I turned the last
page and there was no more. I don't often re-read novels, but this one I will
pick up again sometime.

.section links The "Dodge" Books

_Reamde_ is a modern day thriller that weaves in subplots around cybercrime and
online gaming.  It's a good action story that I'd happily recommend.
_Fall; or, Dodge in Hell_ is a loosely connected sequel centered around mind
uploading.  It has it's moments, but I'd only recommend it if you really love
Stephenson.
