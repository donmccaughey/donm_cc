.section links Revelation Space

<em>Revelation Space</em> is the gateway drug that got me hooked
on Reynolds' strange vision of the future.  It forms
a loosely connected trilogy with <em>Redemption Ark</em> (featuring
a riveting near-light-speed chase between the stars spanning decades) and 
<em>Absolution Gap</em> (with a virus-induced religious cult, moving cathedrals
and a vanishing gas giant). 

<em>Aurora Rising</em> and <em>Elysium Fire</em> form the
<a href=http://approachingpavonis.blogspot.com/2017/07/elysium-fire-and-new-title-for-prefect.html>Prefect
Dreyfuss Emergency</a> sub-series.  They're police procedurals
set in the Glitter Band, a swarm of thousands of orbital habitats.
