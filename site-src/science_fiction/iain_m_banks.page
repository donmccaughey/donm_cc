.page author Iain M Banks

Banks passed away in 2013, and I've been carefully parceling out his remaining
novels since.

Banks creates a vision of a galaxy-spanning post-scarcity future that is
unique, hopeful and somehow very comforting in its humanity.  I was hooked in
the early chapters of _Consider Phlebas_, though lots of folks in
[r/printSF](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/) seem lukewarm on this one.  _The
Player of Games_ and _Use of Weapons_ are probably better and more accessible
starting places.  For me, _Look to Windward_ best captures the heart and soul
of the Culture.
