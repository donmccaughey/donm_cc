Banks passed away in 2013, and I've been carefully parceling out his
remaining novels since.

Banks creates a vision of a galaxy-spanning
post-scarcity future that is unique, hopeful and somehow very comforting
in its humanity.  I was hooked in the early chapters of
<em>Consider Phlebas</em>, though lots of folks in 
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/>r/printSF</a> seem lukewarm
on this one.  <em>The Player of Games</em> and <em>Use of
Weapons</em> are probably better and more accessible starting places.
For me, <em>Look to Windward</em> best captures the heart and soul of
the Culture.
