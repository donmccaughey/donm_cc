.section links The Vorkosigan Saga

The <strong>Vorkosigan Saga</strong> is a fun, pulpy space opera that draws
more on Golden Age science fiction than New Wave or Cyberpunk.

The novels <em>Shards of Honor</em> and <em>Barrayar</em> form a
two-part romance that is also Miles Vorkosigan's origin story.  Most
of the remaining stories feature Miles' picaresque adventures.
