.page links Engineering Management

In 2017 I became an engineering manager, a career change I wasn't looking for
and hadn't previously considered.  My experience as consultant, tech lead and
member of Extreme Programming teams helped in the transition, but there is
still a lot to learn in my new role.

Management is a skill quite different from software engineering, and I still
consider myself a beginner.  This page includes some of the things I've found
useful.
