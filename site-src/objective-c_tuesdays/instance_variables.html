    <h1>Instance Variables</h1>
    <p>
        Last time we talked about 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/local_variables_and_function_parameters.html>local 
        variables and function parameters</a>.  Today we will look at instance 
        variables of Objective-C classes and we'll touch on methods as well.
    <p>
        Objective-C classes are defined by an <code>@interface</code> section 
        and an <code>@implementation</code> section.  The 
        <code>@interface</code> section declares the instance variables and 
        looks like this:
    <pre>@interface Cat : NSObject <mark>{
  NSString *name;
  int age;
}</mark>

- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)aName
            andAge:(int)anAge;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        The instance variables (or <em>ivars</em>) are declared between the 
        curly braces, after the class name and superclass but before method 
        declarations.  Instance variables are declared like any local or global 
        variable, but have a different scope.  By default, instance variables 
        are visible in all instance methods of a class and its subclasses.  
        (Instance methods are the ones that begin with a minus  sign.)  The 
        implementation of the <code>-init</code> method might look like this:
    <pre>// example of using instance variables
@implementation Cat

- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)aName
            andAge:(int)anAge
{
  self = [super init];
  if ( ! self) return nil;
  
  <mark>name</mark> = [aName copy];
  <mark>age</mark> = anAge;
  
  return self;
}

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        This is a pretty standard Objective-C <code>-init</code> method.  Note 
        that unlike JavaScript, Python, Ruby and many other languages, there's 
        no need to prefix instance variables with <code>this</code>, 
        <code>self</code>, <code>@</code> or something similar.  But this leads 
        to a problem: what if a method parameter has the same name as an 
        instance variable?  If our <code>-init</code> method was defined like 
        this:
    <pre>// example of name shadowing
- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)<mark>name</mark>
            andAge:(int)<mark>age</mark>
{
  self = [super init];
  if ( ! self) return nil;
  
  <mark>name</mark> = [<mark>name</mark> copy]; // causes a warning
  <mark>age</mark> = <mark>age</mark>;          // causes a warning
  
  return self;
}</pre>
    <p>
        If you compile this code, you'll see warnings like <code>local 
        declaration of 'name' hides instance variable</code>.  You should heed 
        these warnings! Code like
    <pre>age = age;</pre>
    <p>
        assigns parameter <code>age</code> to itself, leaving the instance 
        variable <code>age</code> unchanged.
    <p>
        Unfortunately there's no elegant way to deal with parameters shadowing 
        instance variables.  Objective-C does allow you to use the "pointer to 
        member" or "arrow" (<code>-></code>) operator on <code>self</code> to 
        access instance variables, like this:
    <pre>// example of pointer to member
- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name
            andAge:(int)age
{
  self = [super init];
  if ( ! self) return nil;
  
  <mark>self->name</mark> = [name copy]; // still causes a warning
  <mark>self->age</mark> = age;          // still causes a warning
  
  return self;
}</pre>
    <p>
        If you know C++ or Java, you would think this would work, but the 
        Objective-C compiler still produces a warning.  This is probably one of 
        the most niggling little differences between Objective-C and other 
        languages that you just need to get over.  The only practical solution 
        is make sure that parameter names don't clash with instance variables.  
        For initializers and setters, most Objective-C programmers simply 
        prefix their parameter names with "<code>a</code>", "<code>an</code>" 
        or "<code>the</code>".  It's not very elegant, but it works.  If you're 
        tempted to simply prefix your instance variable names with an 
        underscore, I recommend against that.  Apple uses the leading 
        underscore convention in framework classes in order to prevent name 
        clashes when application writers have to extend framework classes.
    <h2>The <code>struct</code> behind the curtain</h2>
    <p>
        If you're familiar with C or C++, seeing an expression like 
        <code>self->name</code> should give you a clue to the inner workings of 
        Objective-C.  Underneath, Objective-C objects are pretty much just 
        <code>struct</code>s and functions.  The <code>@interface</code> of our 
        <code>Cat</code> class:
    <pre>@interface Cat : NSObject {
  NSString *name;
  int age;
}
// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        becomes a <code>struct</code> that looks something like:
    <pre>// pseudocode for struct generated for Cat class
struct Cat {
  Class isa;       // inherited from NSObject
  NSString *name;
  int age;
};</pre>
    <p>
        The instance variables you define are tacked on to those defined by the 
        superclass, and its superclass and so on.  So if we defined a subclass 
        of <code>Cat</code>:
    <pre>@interface LolCat : Cat {
  UIImage *picture;
  NSString *caption;
  int upVotes;
}
@end</pre>
    <p>
        the Objective-C compiler would generate a structure in memory that 
        looked something like:
    <pre>// pseudocode for struct generated for LolCat class
struct LolCat {
  Class isa;         // inherited from NSObject
  NSString *name;    // inherited from Cat
  int age;           // inherited from Cat
  UIImage *picture;
  NSString *caption;
  int upVotes;
};</pre>
    <p>
        Similarly, Objective-C methods are simply regular C functions 
        underneath with extra parameters automatically added by the compiler.  
        So our <code>-init</code> method
    <pre>- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)aName
            andAge:(int)anAge
{
  // ...
}</pre>
    <p>
        is compiled into something that resembles:
    <pre>// pseudocode for function generated for -initWithName:andAge: method
id initWithName_andAge(<mark>id self</mark>, <mark>SEL _cmd</mark>, NSString *aName, int anAge) {
  // ...
}</pre>
    <p>
        The parameters <code>self</code> and <code>_cmd</code> are added to 
        each instance method by the compiler.  Naturally, <code>self</code> is 
        a pointer to the memory for the instance, organized like a 
        <code>struct</code> as we've shown.  The <code>_cmd</code> parameter 
        holds the method <em>selector</em> (which is basically the method name) 
        and can be used to do very crazy dynamic stuff we won't dive into today.
    <h2>Instance variable scope</h2>
    <p>
        We mentioned earlier that by default, instance variables are visible in 
        all instance methods of a class and its subclasses.  This is referred 
        to as <em>protected</em> scope in Objective-C.  You can change the 
        scope of instance variables to be <em>private</em>, <em>public</em> or 
        <em>package</em> as well as protected, but in general these other 
        scopes aren't used very frequently in Objective-C.  Going back to our 
        <code>Cat</code> example, you would use the scope specifiers like this:
    <pre>@interface Cat : NSObject {
  // protected by default
    double weight;
  @private
    int lives;
  @protected
    int age;
  @public
    NSString *name;
  @package
    UIColor *color;
}

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        Private scope restricts visibility of the instance variable to the 
        class it's defined in; subclasses are not allowed to use it.  Protected 
        is the default if you don't specify a scope, and allows all subclasses 
        to read and write to the instance variable.  Public scope is rarely 
        seen in Objective-C; the pointer to member or arrow (->) operator is 
        used to access public instance variables:
    <pre>// accessing public instance variables
Cat *cat = [[Cat alloc] init];
NSLog(@"The cat's name is %@", <mark>cat->name</mark>);</pre>
    <p>
        Package scope is used by framework creators; it makes the instance 
        variable public within the framework and private outside it.
    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>
        Since instance variables aren't visible outside classes by default, 
        most Objective-C programmers create getters and setters when they want 
        to expose instance variables.  Before Objective-C 2.0, these were 
        written by hand for each instance variable:
    <pre>// getter and setter declarations
@interface Cat : NSObject {
  NSString *name;
  int age;
}

- (NSString *)name;
- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName;

- (id)age;
- (void)setAge:(int)anAge;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        The normal Objective-C convention is to give the getter the same name 
        as the instance variable and to prefix the setter with "set".  The 
        implementation of simple setters is boilerplate but not trivial due to 
        the need to manage retain counts:
    <pre>// getter and setter definitions
@implementation Cat

- (NSString *)name {
  return name;
}
- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName {
  if (name != aName) {
    [name release];
    name = [aName copy];
  }
}

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        Writing setters manually is both laborious and error prone, so 
        Objective-C 2.0 introduced properties, allowing getters and setters to 
        be generated automatically.  Rewriting the <code>Cat</code> class using 
        properties:
    <pre>// property declaration
@interface Cat : NSObject {
  NSString *name;
  int age;
}

<mark>@property(copy, nonatomic) NSString *name;</mark>
<mark>@property(assign, nonatomic) int age;</mark>

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        And its implementation:
    <pre>// property implementation
@implementation Cat

<mark>@synthesize name, age;</mark>

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        Which is much better.  Properties can be called in two ways.  Dot 
        notation is the most terse and similar to many other languages:
    <pre>// property dot notation example
Cat *cat = [[Cat alloc] init];
NSLog(@"The cat is %d years old", <mark>cat.age</mark>);
<mark>cat.name</mark> = @"Ritz";</pre>
    <p>
        But you can use normal method calls as well:
    <pre>// property method call example
Cat *cat = [[Cat alloc] init];
NSLog(@"The cat is %d years old", <mark>[cat age]</mark>);
<mark>[cat setName:@"Ritz"]</mark>;</pre>
    <p>
        These two examples are exactly equivalent.  Dot notation is simply 
        syntactic sugar for getter and setter method calls.
    <h2>Which is which?</h2>
    <p>
        While it's very convenient, property dot notation makes Objective-C a 
        little confusing at first.  You will sometimes see properties and 
        instance variables mixed together in the same method:
    <pre>- (void)celebrateBirthday {
  <mark>age</mark>++; // instance variable
  if (age > 9) {
    <mark>self.name</mark> = // property
            [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Old %@", 
                                <mark>name</mark>]; // instance variable
  }
}</pre>
    <p>
        At first glance, <code>name</code> and <code>self.name</code> don't 
        seem that different but they are.  We'll examine those differences, and 
        look more at
