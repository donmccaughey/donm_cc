    <h1>Static Variables In Functions</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome back to Objective-C Tuesdays after a long hiatus.  Picking up 
        from <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/static_variables.html>where we left 
        off</a>, today we'll look at <code>static</code> variables declared at 
        function scope.
    <p>
        Normal local variables are declared inside the body of a function:
    <pre>int countCharInString(char c, char const *s) {
  <mark>int count = 0;</mark> // plain old local variable
  do {
    if (*s == c) ++count;
  } while (*s++);
  return count;
  // after we return, count ceases to exist
}</pre>
    <p>
        Plain old local variables exist only for the time that the function is 
        executing.  When the function returns, local variables vanish.
    <p>
        Sometimes you want to keep a value around between calls to a function.  
        Typically you use a global variable for this, but if the variable is 
        only ever used inside a single function, you can use a 
        <code>static</code> variable declared inside the function instead.  One 
        common use for this is to automatically initialize a singleton object 
        or data structure before its first use.  For example:
    <pre>// static variable declared in a function
NSArray *getDaysOfTheWeek() {
  <mark>static</mark> NSArray *daysOfTheWeek = nil;
  if ( ! daysOfTheWeek) {
    daysOfTheWeek = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"Sunday",
                     @"Monday", @"Tuesday", @"Wednesday", 
                     @"Thursday", @"Friday", @"Saturday", nil];
  }
  return daysOfTheWeek;
}</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>static</code> variable <code>daysOfTheWeek</code> is actually 
        a global variable and follows the same rules as global variables with 
        one difference: it's only visible inside the 
        <code>getDaysOfTheWeek()</code> function.  This makes it seem like some 
        magical kind of local variable that keeps its value between function 
        calls, but in fact, you can rewrite <code>getDaysOfTheWeek()</code> to 
        use a normal <code>static</code> global like this:
    <pre>// same function using a static global variable instead
<mark>static</mark> NSArray *daysOfTheWeek = nil;

NSArray *getDaysOfTheWeek() {
  if ( ! daysOfTheWeek) {
    daysOfTheWeek = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"Sunday",
                     @"Monday", @"Tuesday", @"Wednesday", 
                     @"Thursday", @"Friday", @"Saturday", nil];
  }
  return daysOfTheWeek;
}</pre>
    <p>
        There are only a couple of minor advantages to using a 
        <code>static</code> variable declared in a function rather than a 
        normal global:
    <ol>
        <li>
            the <code>static</code> variable lives near the code that uses it
        <li>
            global variable name clashes are avoided
    </ol>
    <p>
        However, because it's a global variable, it suffers from all the 
        problems that global variables do.  Code that make extensive use of 
        global variables is often harder to understand and difficult to reuse.  
        In a multithreaded application, global variables need to be carefully 
        synchronized between threads to avoid data corruption and deadlocks.  
        Global variables also make writing automated tests more difficult and 
        sometimes even impossible.  In general, it's best to avoid using global 
        variables.
