    <h1>Synthesizing Properties</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to another episode of <em>Objective-C Tuesdays</em>.  Today we 
        pick up 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/at-property_and_at-synthesize.html>where 
        we left off</a> and dive into the <code>@synthesize</code> directive 
        that tells the compiler to write getters and setters automatically.
    <p>
        We already saw that the <code>@property</code> directive can shrink the 
        boilerplate code in a class <code>@interface</code> declaration 
        somewhat.  We started with this:
    <pre>@interface Person : NSObject {
  int age;
  Address *address;
  NSString *name;
}

- (int)age;
- (void)setAge:(int)anAge;

- (Address *)address;
- (void)setAddress:(Address *)anAddress;

- (NSString *)name;
- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        And by using properties, we end up with this:
    <pre>@interface Person : NSObject {
  int age;
  Address *address;
  NSString *name;
}

<mark>@property int age;</mark>
<mark>@property (retain) Address *address;</mark>
<mark>@property (copy) NSString *name;</mark>

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        It's not a giant difference, but it's an improvement.  As well as 
        making the code more compact, it separates the logical properties of 
        the class from the rest of the methods.  Where <code>@property</code> 
        really starts to pay off is when we combine it with 
        <code>@synthesize</code>.  The <code>@implementation</code> for the 
        <code>Person</code> class looks like this:
    <pre>// hand written getter and setter methods
@implementation Person

- (int)age {
  return age;
}

// assign-type setter
- (void)setAge:(int)anAge {
  age = anAge;
}

- (Address *)address {
  return address;
}

// retain-type setter
- (void)setAddress:(Address *)anAddress {
  if (address != anAddress) {
    [address release];
    address = [anAddress retain];
  }
}

- (NSString *)name {
  return name;
}

// copy-type setter
- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName {
  if (name != aName) {
    [name release];
    name = [aName copy];
  }
}

// ...

@end</pre>
    <p>
        That's a lot of boilerplate code to churn out, and memory management in 
        the retain and copy type setters makes it more error prone than simple 
        assign type setters.  It's just begging to be machine generated, so 
        let's do that:
    <pre>// synthesized getter and setter methods
@implementation Person

<mark>@synthesize age, address, name;</mark>

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        All that onerous code can be deleted, and the compiler now generates 
        the correct type of getters and setters based on the attributes of the 
        corresponding <code>@property</code> directive.  Note that to use 
        <code>@synthesize</code>, you <em>must</em> have a corresponding 
        <code>@property</code> in the <code>@interface</code> section.  I like 
        to put the property names in a list after <code>@synthesize</code>, but 
        you can have multiple <code>@synthesize</code> lines if you like, with 
        one or several property names per line:
    <pre>@implementation Person

<mark>@synthesize age;</mark>
<mark>@synthesize address, name;</mark>

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        If you need to provide a particular getter or setter yourself, but you 
        want the compiler to write the rest of them, you simply add it to your 
        <code>@implementation</code>.  The compiler looks first to see what you 
        provided before it generates anything.  So if we need to do a check 
        when setting the <code>age</code> of a <code>Person</code> instance, we 
        simply write our own setter:
    <pre>// synthesized getter and setter methods
// with one custom setter
@implementation Person

@synthesize age, address, name;

- (void)setAge:(int)anAge {
  age = anAge;
  if (age >= 55) {
    [[JunkMailer sharedJunkMailer] addPersonTo<a href=https://www.aarp.org>AARP</a>MailingList:self];
  }
}

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        This is great, but sometimes you want the property to have a different 
        name than the instance variable that backs it up.  For example, we 
        might call the instance variable <code>ageInYears</code>, but want to 
        call the property <code>age</code>:
    <pre>@interface Person : NSObject {
  int <mark>ageInYears</mark>;
  // ...
}

@property int <mark>age</mark>;

// ...
@end


@implementation Person

@synthesize <mark>age</mark>, address, name;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        This confuses the compiler and it complains:
    <pre>synthesized property 'age' must either be named the same as a compatible ivar or must explicitly name an ivar</pre>
    <p>
        So how do we tell it to use the instance variable 
        <code>ageInYears</code> when generating the <code>age</code> property?  
        The <code>@synthesize</code> directive has one modifier, which solves 
        our problem:
    <pre>@implementation Person

@synthesize <mark>age = ageInYears</mark>, address, name;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        That wraps up normal usage of <code>@synthesize</code>.  Next week, we 
        look at one attribute of <code>@property</code> that we've neglected so 
        far: 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/atomic_and_nonatomic_properties.html><code>nonatomic</code></a>.
