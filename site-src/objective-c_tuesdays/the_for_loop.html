    <h1>The For Loop</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the first episode of <em>Objective-C Tuesdays</em>.  We'll 
        be focusing on C and Objective-C basics.  Today we will look at the 
        standard C language <code>for</code> loop.
    <p>
        The <code>for</code> loop is the most flexible looping statement in C, 
        and the most common.  It groups all the important loop information 
        together at the start of the loop, making it quick and easy to both 
        read and write.
    <p>
        The <code>for</code> loop statement starts with the keyword 
        <code>for</code>, followed by parentheses containing the loop 
        definition.  The loop definition contains three expressions separated 
        by semicolons: <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em> and 
        <em>action</em>.  After the parentheses, a single <em>statement</em> or 
        <em>block</em> makes up the body of the loop.
    <pre>/* for loop with a single statement */
for (<mark>initialization</mark>; <mark>condition</mark>; <mark>action</mark>) <mark>statement</mark>;

/* for loop with a block */
for (<mark>initialization</mark>; <mark>condition</mark>; <mark>action</mark>)
{
  <mark>block</mark>;
}</pre>
    <p>
        Watch out for a hard to spot bug when the <code>for</code> loop is 
        followed by an empty statement created by an extra semicolon:
    <pre>for (<mark>initialization</mark>; <mark>condition</mark>; <mark>action</mark>); /* &lt;-- warning! empty statement! */
{
  /* this block is not part of the loop */
  /* it's always executed exactly once  */
}</pre>
    <h2>Initialization</h2>
    <p>
        The <em>initialization</em> expression is where the starting value of 
        the loop counter variable is set.  The <em>initialization</em> 
        expression is evaluated once before the <code>for</code> loop begins 
        executing.  Loop counters are commonly integer types, but can be any 
        type that makes sense in your code.  In modern versions of C and 
        Objective-C, the loop counter can be declared in the 
        <em>initialization</em> section as well.  The loop counter is typically 
        given the name <code>i</code> (or <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> in 
        nested loops).  In <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99>C99</a> 
        and later, <em>initialization</em> looks like: 
    <pre>for (<mark>int i = 0</mark>; <mark>condition</mark>; <mark>action</mark>)</pre>
    <p>
        In older versions of C, the loop counter must be declared somewhere 
        before the <code>for</code> loop: 
    <pre><mark>int i</mark>;
/* ... */
for (<mark>i = 0</mark>; <mark>condition</mark>; <mark>action</mark>)</pre>
    <h2>Condition</h2>
    <p>
        The <em>condition</em> expression is evaluated before each iteration; 
        the loop continues while the <em>condition</em> evaluates to 
        <code>true</code> or non-zero and stops when the <em>condition</em> 
        evaluates to <code>false</code> or zero.  The <em>condition</em> 
        expression is often a "less than" (<code>&lt;</code>) or "less than or 
        equal to" (<code>&lt;=</code>) expression: 
    <pre>for (int i = 0; <mark>i &lt; 10</mark>; <mark>action</mark>)</pre>
    <p>
        or 
    <pre>for (int i = 1; <mark>i &lt;= 10</mark>; <mark>action</mark>)</pre>
    <p>
        but it can be any expression that makes sense in your code.
    <h2>Action</h2>
    <p>
        The <em>action</em> expression is evaluated at the end of each 
        iteration, after the <em>condition</em> and the body of the loop are 
        executed.  The <em>action</em> is typically used to increment or 
        decrement the loop counter, but can be used to perform any action that 
        makes sense for your code.  Most of the time, you simply want to 
        increment the counter by one:
    <pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; <mark>i++</mark>)</pre>
    <p>
        but other increments are easy to do:
    <pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; <mark>i += 2</mark>)</pre>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        Putting this all together, here's some Objective-C code to count from 0 
        to 5 and back to zero: 
    <pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
  NSLog(@"%i", i);
}
for (int i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {
  NSLog(@"%i", i);
}</pre>
    <p>
        The output looks like this: 
    <pre>0
1
2
3
4
5
4
3
2
1
0</pre>

        we'll look at some of the crazy and complicated ways you can use the 
        <code>for</code> loop.
