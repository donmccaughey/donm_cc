    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome back to Objective-C Tuesdays. Last time we wrapped up our 
        series on strings by looking at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/regular_expressions.html>regular 
        expressions in Objective-C</a>. Today we begin a new series: <em>data 
        structures</em>. The first data structure that we will examine is the 
        array.
    <p>
        Most languages have some concept of an array, though it is sometimes 
        called a list. In general, an <em>array</em> is an <em>ordered 
        sequence</em>: a collection of items that has a distinct order. The 
        term "array" implies that each item in the collection is individually 
        accessible in <em>constant time</em>; in other words, it takes the same 
        amount of time to access items at the beginning, middle or end of the 
        sequence.
    <h2>Arrays in C</h2>
    <p>
        The C language includes the ability to define and create strongly typed 
        arrays. You must always declare the type of the items that the array 
        contains.
    <pre>// declare an array of ints
int lotteryNumbers[6];</pre>
    <p>
        This declares an array that holds six integers. When the array variable 
        is declared, the number between the square brackets indicates the 
        number of items that the array can hold, usually referred to as the 
        size, length or count.
    <p>
        C99 (which is the default for iOS projects) allows you to use a 
        function parameter or other variable to determine the length of an 
        array. This feature is naturally called "variable length arrays".
    <pre>// use a variable as the length of an array
int length = 6;
int lotteryNumbers[length];</pre>
    <p>
        Unless you're an old time C programmer, you're probably thinking "yeah, 
        so what?" In earlier versions of C, you could only declare arrays with 
        <em>constant</em> length. In old C code (or code written old C hands), 
        it's common to see code like this:
    <pre>// constant array length
#define LOTTERY_NUMBERS_LENGTH 6

int lotteryNumbers[LOTTERY_NUMBERS_LENGTH];</pre>
    <h2>C array initialization</h2>
    <p>
        You can optionally provide an array with an initializer. An array 
        initializer uses curly braces and looks like this:
    <pre>// array initializer
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };</pre>
    <p>
        You can specify fewer items than the array can hold; the remaining 
        items will be initialized to zero.
    <pre>// array with partial initializer
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11 };</pre>
    <p>
        You can even specify an empty initializer and all the items in the 
        array will be set to zero.
    <pre>// array with empty initializer
int lotteryNumbers[6] = {};</pre>
    <p>
        This is redundant for arrays declared at global scope since global 
        variables are initialized to zero by default, but can be useful for 
        local variables.
    <p>
        If you use an initializer list when you declare your array, you can 
        leave the array length out of the declaration:
    <pre>// array initializer without length
int lotteryNumbers[] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };</pre>
    <p>
        The compiler will count the items in the initializer list and size your 
        array to fit.
    <p>
        If you are initializing an array of <code>char</code>s, you can use a 
        string literal as the initializer.
    <pre>char favoriteColor[4] = "red";
char favoriteFlavor[] = "vanilla";</pre>
    <p>
        Remember that C strings contain an extra <code>char</code>, the 
        <em>null terminator</em>, so when you initialize an array of 
        <code>char</code>s with the string <code>"red"</code>, it actually 
        stores four items. You can make the equivalent initializers using 
        character literals:
    <pre>char favoriteColor[4] = { 'r', 'e', 'd', 0 };
char favoriteFlavor[] = { 'v', 'a', 'n', 'i', 'l', 'l', 'a', '\0' };</pre>
    <h2>Accessing items in an array</h2>
    <p>
        You get items out of an array by using an array index number in square 
        brackets:
    <pre>int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };

NSLog(@"%i is at index 1", lotteryNumbers[1]);
NSLog(@"%i is at index 2", lotteryNumbers[2]);</pre>
    <p>
        The code snippet above produces this output:
    <pre>11 is at index 1
19 is at index 2</pre>
    <p>
        If this is surprising, it's because the first item in a C array is 
        always at index 0.
    <p>
        Assigning items to an array is naturally very similar:
    <pre>int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };

lotteryNumbers[1] = 13;
lotteryNumbers[2] = 17;
NSLog(@"%i is at index 1", lotteryNumbers[1]);
NSLog(@"%i is at index 2", lotteryNumbers[2]);</pre>
    <p>
        which will print out:
    <pre>13 is at index 1
17 is at index 2</pre>
    <h2>Arrays automatically convert to pointers</h2>
    <p>
        Like all things in C, arrays are very low level constructs. Under the 
        hood, an array is simply a block of memory managed by the compiler 
        that's large enough to hold all its items. Because an array corresponds 
        directly to a memory block, an array variable will automatically 
        convert into a pointer to the first item in the array.
    <pre>// automatic array to pointer conversion
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };
int *luckyNumber = lotteryNumbers;

NSLog(@"My lucky number is %i", *luckyNumber</pre>
    <p>
        This will produce the output:
    <pre>My lucky number is 7</pre>
    <p>
        You can set the pointer to items after the first by using <em>pointer 
        arithmetic</em>:
    <pre>// pointer arithmetic
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };
int *luckyNumber = lotteryNumbers;

NSLog(@"My NEW lucky number is %i", <mark>*(luckyNumber + 1)</mark></pre>
    <p>
        which prints out the 
    <pre>My NEW lucky number is 11</pre>
    <p>
        While pointer arithmetic is a perfectly 
        <a href=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cromulent>cromulent</a> way to 
        access items in an array, you can use an index in square brackets on a 
        pointer just as you can on an array:
    <pre>// array index using a pointer variable
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };
int *luckyNumber = lotteryNumbers;

NSLog(@"My NEW lucky number is %i", <mark>luckyNumber[1]</mark></pre>
    <p>
        Under the hood, the compiler automatically converts uses of an array 
        variable into a pointer to the first item in the array, then converts 
        array index expressions into the equivalent pointer arithmetic. An 
        expression like <code>myArray[2]</code> is converted to <code>*(myArray 
        + 2)</code>, or a pointer to the third item in the array. (Remember 
        that the first item is <code>myArray[0]</code>.)
    <p>
        While this is a very convenient way to work with low level memory in a 
        structured way, it can also be very dangerous. The compiler won't stop 
        you from accessing items past the end of your array. You can easily and 
        efficiently read memory that may contain garbage values and overwrite 
        memory belonging to other parts of your program. As with many things in 
        C, with great power comes great responsibility.
    <h2>Calculating the length of an array</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>sizeof</code> operator can be applied to an array variable to 
        find out how many <em>bytes</em> of memory the array occupies.
    <pre>// size of an array in bytes
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };

NSLog(@"The array uses %lu bytes", <mark>sizeof lotteryNumbers</mark>);</pre>
    <p>
        This produces:
    <pre>The lotteryNumbers array uses 24 bytes</pre>
    <p>
        <code>int</code>s in iOS use four bytes each, so an array of six 
        <code>int</code>s uses 24 bytes. (The <code>sizeof</code> operator 
        returns a value of type <code>size_t</code>, an unsigned long integer 
        type.) To get the number of items the array contains, you can divide 
        the size of the array by the size of its first item:
    <pre>// size of an array in bytes
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 31 };

size_t length = <mark>sizeof lotteryNumbers / sizeof lotteryNumbers[0]</mark>;
NSLog(@"The array contains %lu items", length);</pre>
    <p>
        Be careful to only use this on actual <em>array</em> variables—you 
        won't get the answer you expect if you try this on a pointer.
    <p>
        C arrays have one big limitation: you can't resize them. We'll talk 
        about using dynamically allocated memory blocks as arrays next time.
    <h2><code>NSArray</code></h2>
    <p>
        If you're ready for a safer, higher level way to manage an ordered 
        sequence of items, it's time to get to know <code>NSArray</code>.
    <p>
        You can create an <code>NSArray</code> containing one item using 
        <code>+arrayWithObject:</code> or <code>-initWithObject:</code>
    <pre>// creating an NSArray with one item
NSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObject:@"red"];
NSArray *flavors = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObject:@"vanilla"];</pre>
    <p>
        <code>NSArray</code> creation methods follow the common Cocoa and Cocoa 
        Touch conventions. Class methods like <code>+arrayWithObject:</code> 
        return a new autoreleased object. If you need to hold on to the object 
        beyond the current method, remember to call <code>-retain</code> on it. 
        Instance methods like <code>-initWithObject:</code> produce new objects 
        that you own—don't forget to call <code>-release</code> or 
        <code>-autorelease</code> on the object when you're done with it.
    <p>
        Sometimes an array containing one item is handy, but usually you want 
        to hold onto multiple items. To do that, use 
        <code>+arrayWithObjects:</code> or <code>-initWithObjects:</code>:
    <pre>// creating an NSArray with multiple items
NSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"red", 
                                            @"green", 
                                            @"blue", 
                                            <mark>nil</mark>];
NSArray *flavors = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"vanilla", 
                                                    @"chocolate", 
                                                    @"strawberry", 
                                                    <mark>nil</mark>];</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>+arrayWithObjects:</code> or <code>-initWithObjects:</code> 
        methods take a variable number of arguments, but have a special caveat: 
        you must mark the end of the list with <code>nil</code>. If you forget 
        the <code>nil</code>, your program will probably crash with an 
        <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> error as it tries to add random memory 
        locations to the <code>NSArray</code>. Fortunately, the LLVM 2.0 
        compiler in Xcode 4.0 will warn you if you forget the <code>nil</code>. 
        Always pay attention to compiler warnings!
    <p>
        If you have a plain old C array of object pointers, you can use the 
        <code>+arrayWithObjects:count:</code> or 
        <code>-initWithObjects:count</code> methods to create an 
        <code>NSArray</code> from the C array.
    <pre>// creating an NSArray from a C array
NSString *colors1[] = { @"red", @"green", @"blue" };
NSArray *colors2 = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:colors1 count:3];

NSString *flavors1[] = { @"vanilla", @"chocolate", @"strawberry" };
NSArray *flavors2 = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:flavors1 count:3];</pre>
    <p>
        Accessing an item in an array is done with the 
        <code>-objectAtIndex:</code> method.
    <pre>// my favorite color is green
NSArray *colors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"red", 
                                            @"green", 
                                            @"blue", 
                                            nil];

NSLog(@"My favorite color is %@", [colors objectAtIndex:1]);</pre>
    <p>
        You can ask an <code>NSArray</code> object how many items it contains 
        using the <code>-count</code> method.
    <pre>NSArray *favoriteColors = [NSArray arrayWithObject:@"green"];
NSArray *favoriteFlavors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"vanilla", @"chocolate", nil];

NSLog(@"I have %u favorite color(s) and %u favorite flavor(s)", 
      [favoriteColors count], [favoriteFlavors count]);</pre>
    <h2>Only for objects, but heterogeneous</h2>
    <p>
        <code>NSArray</code> has one big limitation: it can only contain object 
        types. If you try to create an <code>NSArray</code> of 
        <code>int</code>s or a similar primitive C type, you'll get a warning 
        like "Incompatible integer to pointer conversion sending 'int' to 
        parameter of type 'id'". If you need to store numbers in an 
        <code>NSArray</code>, you can store <code>NSNumber</code> objects 
        instead.
    <pre>// wrap primitive types in objects to store them in an NSArray
NSNumber *one = [NSNumber numberWithInt:1];
NSNumber *pi = [NSNumber numberWithDouble:3.14];
NSDate *today = [NSDate date];
NSString *foo = [NSString stringWithContentsOfCString:"foo" encoding:NSUTF8Encoding];

NSArray *myStuff = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:one, pi, today, foo, nil];</pre>
    <p>
        This example shows an interesting characteristic of 
        <code>NSArray</code>s: they can hold items of many different object 
        types in a single container. While occasionally this feature is useful, 
        more often than not you'll only store items of one type in a given 
        <code>NSArray</code>, and errors related to finding an unexpected type 
        in your <code>NSArray</code>s are pretty rare.
    <h2><code>NSArray</code>s are immutable</h2>
    <p>
        Like plain old C arrays, once you create an <code>NSArray</code>, you 
        can't change its size. But <code>NSArray</code>s are even more 
        restrictive; you can't change the contents either. 
        <code>NSArray</code>s are <em>immutable</em>. This is something of a 
        pain in the rump, but it means that you can safely share an 
        <code>NSArray</code> between threads, as long as the items in it are 
        also immutable.
    <p>
        Next time, we'll look at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/dynamic_arrays.html>using memory blocks 
        as resizable C arrays, and <code>NSArray</code>'s more flexible cousin, 
        <code>NSMutableArray</code></a>.
