    <h1>The Do...While Loop</h1>
    <p>
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/the_while_loop.html>Last time</a> we 
        looked at the <code>while</code> loop.  Today we'll examine it's 
        sibling the <code>do...while</code> loop.
    <p>
        Unlike the <code>while</code> loop, the <code>do...while</code> loop is 
        guaranteed to execute the loop body at least once.  The loop 
        <em>condition</em> is checked at the end of each loop iteration.
    <p>
        The <code>do...while</code> loop starts with the keyword <code>do</code>
         followed by a single <em>statement</em> or <em>block</em> that makes 
        up the body of the loop.  The loop body is followed by the keyword 
        <code>while</code> and parentheses containing the <em>condition</em> 
        with a semicolon at the end.
    <p>
        The <code>do...while</code> loop is almost always written on three or 
        more lines, and almost always with a block instead of a single 
        statement.
    <pre>/* do...while loop with a single statement */
do
  <mark>statement</mark>;
while (<mark>condition</mark>);

/* do...while loop with a block */
do {
  <mark>block</mark>;
} while (<mark>condition</mark>);</pre>
    <p>
        Initialization of the loop counter or other loop variables must be done 
        before the <code>do...while</code> statement; this often means 
        declaring and initializing a local variable:
    <pre>int i = 0;
do {
  /* ... */
} while (i &lt; 10);</pre>
    <p>
        When using a loop counter, it's important to remember to advance the 
        counter to the next value in the body of the loop.  For instance, to 
        log the numbers 0 through 9: 
    <pre>int i = 0;
do {
  NSLog(@"%d", i);
  <mark>i++; /* advance the loop counter */</mark>
} while (i &lt; 10);</pre>
    <p>
        If you forget to advance the loop counter, you'll create an infinite 
        loop. 
    <pre>int i = 0;
/* warning, infinite loop, i is always 0 */
do {
  NSLog(@"%d", i);
  <mark>/* oops, forgot to increment i */</mark>
} while (i &lt; 10);</pre>
    <p>
        The key thing that differentiates the <code>do...while</code> loop from 
        the <code>while</code> loop is that it always executes the loop body at 
        least once; the <code>while</code> loop doesn't guarantee that.  An 
        example of this difference: 
    <pre>BOOL looping = NO;

NSLog(@"before while loop:");
while (looping) {
  NSLog(@"  executing the while loop");
}
NSLog(@"after while loop:");

NSLog(@"before do...while loop:");
do {
  NSLog(@"  executing the do...while loop");
} while (looping);
NSLog(@"after do...while loop:");</pre>
    <p>
        The output of these two loops looks like this: 
    <pre>before while loop:
after while loop:
before do...while loop:
  executing the do...while loop
after do...while loop:</pre>
    <p>
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/break_out_of_a_loop.html>Next week</a>, 
        we'll look at using <code>break</code> to break out of a loop.
