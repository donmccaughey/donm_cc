    <h1>Replacing In Strings</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome back to Objective-C Tuesdays!  Today we follow closely on last 
        week's topic of 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/searching_in_strings.html>searching in 
        strings</a> with it's sibling, replacing in strings.
    <h2>It's a nightmare in C</h2>
    <p>
        In our series on strings in Objective-C, we've usually started by 
        looking at C strings then moved on to <code>NSString</code>s.  Today is 
        no different.  In most cases, using <code>NSString</code> is easier 
        than doing the equivalent operation on C strings.  When it comes to 
        replacing characters in a string, using <code>NSString</code> is 
        <em>significantly</em> easier and safer.  The standard C library 
        doesn't provide much support for doing common string replacement 
        operations, so you have to implement them yourself.  Because of all the 
        manual memory management required when working with C strings, this 
        code is very error prone -- writing off the end of a buffer and 
        forgetting to add the null terminator are two very common types of 
        errors you have to watch out for when working with C strings.
    <h2>Replacing a character</h2>
    <p>
        The only replacement operation that's fairly straightforward on C 
        strings is replacing a single character with another character.  Since 
        C strings are just pointers to arrays of <code>char</code>s, you simply 
        calculate the pointer to the <code>char</code> you want to change, 
        dereference the pointer and assign the new <code>char</code> value.
    <p>
        There are two variations of this.  The first one uses array notation 
        and the second pointer operations.  In both examples below, we use the 
        <code>strdup()</code> function to make a copy of our original C string. 
         The <code>strdup()</code> function isn't part of the C standard 
        library, but most systems have one available (possibly named 
        <code>_strdup()</code>) and it's easy to write one if it's missing on 
        your system (it's available on iOS).  You own the string returned by 
        <code>strdup()</code> and are responsible for calling 
        <code>free()</code> when you're done with it.
    <p>
        Here's how you change a character in a C string by treating it as an 
        array of <code>char</code>s:
    <pre>char const *source = "foobar";

char *copy = strdup(source); // make a non-const copy of source

copy[3] = 'B';               // change char at index 3

NSLog(@"copy = %@", copy);
// prints "copy = foo<mark>B</mark>ar"

free(copy);                  // free copy when done</pre>
    <p>
        The alternative way uses pointer arithmetic:
    <pre>char const *source = "foobar";

char *copy = strdup(source); // make a non-const copy of source

char *c3 = copy + 3;         // get pointer to char at index 3

*c3 = 'B';                   // change char at address of c3

NSLog(@"copy = %@", copy);
// prints "copy = foo<mark>B</mark>ar"

free(copy);                  // free copy when done</pre>
    <p>
        As far as the compiler is concerned, this is basically the same code so 
        use whichever method makes the most sense.  If you know the index of 
        the <code>char</code> you want to change, use array notation.  If you 
        already have a pointer to the <code>char</code>, perhaps from calling 
        <code>strchr()</code>, use the pointer directly.
    <h2>Replacing a substring</h2>
    <p>
        Replacing a substring of a C string is harder.  In the case where the 
        original and the replacement have the same number of 
        <code>char</code>s, you can call <code>str<mark>n</mark>cpy()</code> to 
        copy over the characters.
    <pre>// replacing a substring of equal length
char const *source = "foobar";

char *copy = strdup(source); // make a non-const copy of source

char *c2 = copy + 2;         // get pointer to char at index 2

strncpy(c2, "OBA", 3);       // copy 3 chars

NSLog(@"copy = %s", copy);
// prints "copy = foOBAr"

free(copy);                  // free copy when done</pre>
    <p>
        Replacing a substring with a different sized one is even more complex.  
        There are three special cases that need to be handled: the substring to 
        replace is at the start of the original, in the middle, or at the end.  
        When the replacement substring is smaller than the original, there are 
        some short cuts you can take to make the code a little simpler, but 
        we'll only show the general case.
    <p>
        We'll look at the second case, replacing a substring in the middle of 
        the original.  With a little extra logic, this code can be adapted to 
        handle all three of our cases.
    <pre>char const *source = "The rain in Spain";
char const *original = "rain";     // substring to find
char const *replacement = "plane"; // substring to replace

// calculate the required buffer size
// including space for the null terminator
size_t size = strlen(source) - strlen(original) 
            + strlen(replacement) + sizeof(char);

// allocate buffer
char *buffer = calloc(size, sizeof(char));
if ( ! buffer) {
  // handle allocation failure
}

// find original substring in source and
// calculate the length of the unchanged prefix
char *originalInSource = strstr(source, original);
size_t prefixLength = originalInSource - source;

// copy prefix "The " into buffer
strncpy(buffer, source, prefixLength);

// calculate where the replacement substring goes in the buffer
char *replacementInBuffer = buffer + prefixLength;

// copy replacement "plane" into buffer
strcpy(replacementInBuffer, replacement);

// find position of unchanged suffix in source and
// calculate where it goes in the buffer
char const *suffixInSource = originalInSource + strlen(original);
char *suffixInBuffer = replacementInBuffer + strlen(replacement);

// copy suffix " in Spain" into buffer
strcpy(suffixInBuffer, suffixInSource);

NSLog(@"buffer = %s", buffer);
// prints "buffer = The plane in Spain"

free(buffer); // free buffer when done</pre>
    <p>
        I won't even waste your time explaining this in detail.  <em>No one 
        programming in a modern computer language should have to write this 
        code!</em>  It's extremely error prone and is one of the main causes of 
        security vulnerabilities.  If you find yourself doing this, <em>stop 
        immediately</em> and seek out one of the 
        <a href=http://www.and.org/vstr/comparison>many managed string 
        libraries for C</a> that are available.  If you're writing code for 
        iOS, you should be using <code>NSString</code> to do this.
    <h2>Replacing using <code>NSString</code></h2>
    <p>
        The <code>NSString</code> class has a number of useful methods for 
        replacing characters and substrings in an <code>NSString</code>.  
        Because <code>NSString</code> is immutable, these methods all return a 
        new <code>NSString</code> instance containing the replacements, leaving 
        the source <code>NSString</code> unchanged.
    <p>
        When you know the exact area of the string you want to replace, you can 
        use the <code>-stringByReplacingCharactersInRange:withString:</code> 
        method with an <code>NSRange</code> structure, which has fields for 
        <code>location</code> (the zero-based index to start at) and 
        <code>length</code> (the number of characters in the source string to 
        replace).  Because <code>NSString</code> does all the memory management 
        for you and returns a new autoreleased <code>NSString</code>, it's 
        child's play compared to doing this with C strings.
    <pre>// replace a range in an NSString
NSString *source = @"The rain in Spain";
NSRange range;

range.location = 4; // starting index in source
range.length = 3;   // number of characters to replace in source

NSString *copy = [source stringByReplacingCharactersInRange:range 
                                                 withString:@"trai"];

NSLog(@"copy = %@", copy);
// prints "copy = The train in Spain"

// no need to release anything
// copy is autoreleased</pre>
    <p>
        This is a definite improvement over working with C strings.  You might 
        actually do this in real code without tearing your hair out or causing 
        a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow>buffer 
        overrun</a> bug.  We can make this code even more compact by using the 
        <code>NSMakeRange()</code> function to create the <code>NSRange</code> 
        structure.
    <pre>// replace a range in an NSString
NSString *source = @"The rain in Spain";

// create range in line
NSString *copy = [source stringByReplacingCharactersInRange:<mark>NSMakeRange(4, 3)</mark>
                                                 withString:@"trai"];

NSLog(@"copy = %@", copy);
// prints "copy = The train in Spain"

// no need to release anything
// copy is autoreleased</pre>
    <p>
        If you don't know ahead of time what part of the string you want to 
        replace, you can do a find and replace in one method.  The 
        <code>-stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:withString:</code> method 
        will find <em>all</em> occurrences of one <code>NSString</code> in 
        another and replace them, returning a new autoreleased 
        <code>NSString</code>.
    <pre>// find and replace one substring with another
NSString *source = @"The rain in Spain";

NSString *copy = [source stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"ain"
                                                   withString:@"oof"];

NSLog(@"copy = %@", copy);
// prints "copy = The roof in Spoof"</pre>
    <p>
        There is another variation of this method that gives you more control 
        over how substrings are found and replaced.  The 
        <code>-stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:withString:options:range:</code>
         method allows you to specify a mask containing one or more options and 
        an <code>NSRange</code> structure allowing you to restrict the 
        operation to a section of the string.  The most common option is 
        <code>NSCaseInsensitiveSearch</code>, which matches the substring 
        without regard to case.
    <pre>// case insensitive replace
NSString *source = @"&lt;BR>The rain&lt;BR>in Spain";

NSString *copy = [source stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"&lt;br>"
                                                   withString:@"&lt;p>"
                                                      options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch
                                                        range:NSMakeRange(0, [source length])];

NSLog(@"copy = %@", copy);
// prints "copy = "&lt;p>The rain&lt;p>in Spain"</pre>
    <p>
        Another handy search option is <code>NSAnchoredSearch</code>, which 
        searches only at the start of the source string.  Notice that you use 
        the bitwise or (<code>|</code>) operator to combine multiple options 
        together.
    <pre>// anchored, case insensitive replace
NSString *source = @"&lt;BR>The rain&lt;BR>in Spain";

NSString *copy = [source stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"&lt;br>"
                                                   withString:@"&lt;p>"
                                                      options:NSAnchoredSearch | NSCaseInsensitiveSearch
                                                        range:NSMakeRange(0, [source length])];

NSLog(@"copy = %@", copy);
// prints "copy = "&lt;p>The rain&lt;BR>in Spain"</pre>
    <p>
        You can combine the <code>NSBackwardsSearch</code> with 
        <code>NSAnchoredSearch</code> to only replace the substring if it 
        occurs at the end of the source instead of at the beginning.
    <h2>Replacing in <code>NSMutableString</code></h2>
    <p>
        If you're working with an <code>NSMutableString</code>, you can still 
        call any of the <code>-stringByReplacing...</code> methods to produce a 
        new <code>NSString</code>, but you have the option of making the 
        replacements in the <code>NSMutableString</code> directly.  The method 
        <code>-replaceCharactersInRange:withString:</code> is very similar to 
        the <code>-stringByReplacingCharactersInRange:withString</code> method:
    <pre>// replace a range in an NSMutableString
NSMutableString *source = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@"The rain in Spain"];

[source replaceCharactersInRange:NSMakeRange(4, 3)
                      withString:@"trai"];

NSLog(@"source = %@", source);
// prints "source = The train in Spain"</pre>
    <p>
        The method 
        <code>-replaceOccurrencesOfString:withString:options:range:</code> 
        works similarly.
    <p>
        In most cases, there's not much of an advantage to replacing in place 
        in an <code>NSMutableString</code> versus creating a new 
        <code>NSString</code> containing the replacement.  Use whichever 
        operation is most convenient.  If you need to make many replacements on 
        a very long string, there <em>may</em> be an advantage to replacing in 
        place rather than creating many large temporary <code>NSString</code> 
        instances that live in the autorelease pool.
    <p>
        So far, the searching and replacing methods we've seen have done only 
        simple string matching.  Next week, we'll look at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/regular_expressions.html>more powerful 
        string matching using regular expressions</a>.
