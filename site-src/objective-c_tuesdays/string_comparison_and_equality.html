    <h1>String Comparison And Equality</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome back after an end-of-Summer hiatus.  Last time we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/concatenating_strings.html>concatenating 
        strings in Objective-C</a>.  Today we look at another common string 
        operation: comparison.
    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p>
        Comparing two variables or objects can sometimes be a tricky 
        proposition.  There are several different senses of equality.  The most 
        fundamental type of equality is <em>identity</em>: do two variables 
        represent the same thing in memory.  Identity only makes sense for 
        reference types, like C strings, <code>NSString</code>s and other 
        pointer types.  Value types like <code>int</code>s always designate 
        separate things in memory.  In C and Objective-C, identity equality is 
        determined by comparing pointer values using the <code>==</code> 
        operator.
    <pre>// comparing two strings for identity
char const s1 = "foo";
char const s2 = s1;
if (s1 == s2) {
  NSLog(@"s1 is identical to s2");
}

NSString *s3 = @"foo";
NSString *s4 = @"bar";
if (s3 != s4) {
  NSLog(@"s3 is not identical to s4");
}</pre>
    <h2>Equivalence</h2>
    <p>
        A more useful type of equality is <em>equivalence of value</em>: do two 
        variables represent equivalent data.  Equivalence is useful when 
        comparing value types as well as reference types, and is usually what 
        programmers think of when comparing two strings.
    <p>
        For C strings, the primary equivalence test is done with the 
        <code>strcmp()</code> function.  The <code>strcmp()</code> function 
        compares the data of two C strings <code>char</code> by 
        <code>char</code>; if two C strings represent the same sequence of 
        <code>char</code> values in memory, they are equivalent and 
        <code>strcmp()</code> returns zero.
    <pre>// checking two C strings for equal value
char const *s1 = "foo";
char const *s2 = "bar";

if (strcmp(s1, s2) == 0) {
  NSLog(@"s1 is equivalent to s2");
} else {
  NSLog(@"s1 is not equivalent to s2");
}</pre>
    <p>
        In addition to checking for equivalence, <code>strcmp()</code> also 
        categorizes the sort order of the two C strings.  If the first argument 
        comes <em>before</em> the second, a negative value is returned; if the 
        first argument comes <em>after</em> the second, a positive value is 
        returned.  The <code>strcmp()</code> function uses a lexicographic 
        comparison, which means that the comparison is strictly on the basis of 
        the integer values of the <code>char</code>s in the C strings.  For 
        ASCII strings, the string <code>"2"</code> (ASCII code 50) comes before 
        <code>"A"</code> (ASCII code 64), which precedes <code>"a"</code> 
        (ASCII code 97).  Many sorting algorithms, including the 
        <code>qsort()</code> function in the C standard library, require a 
        function like <code>strcmp()</code>.
    <pre>// using strcmp() result

int compareResult = strcmp(s1, s2);
if (compareResult &lt; 0) {
  NSLog(@"s1 comes before s2");
} else if (compareResult > 0) {
  NSLog(@"s1 comes after s2");
}</pre>
    <p>
        Sometimes you only want to see if two strings have a common prefix, or 
        you're working with character buffers that aren't null terminated.  The 
        <code>str<mark>n</mark>cmp()</code> function will compare a limited 
        number of characters, stopping early if it encounters a null terminator 
        in either string.  Thus these two strings are equivalent when the first 
        three characters are compared:
    <pre>if (<mark>strncmp</mark>("foo", "fooey", <mark>3</mark>) == 0) {
  NSLog(@"both start with foo");
}
// prints "both start with foo"</pre>
    <p>
        When sorting with <code>strncmp()</code>, short strings come first:
    <pre>if (<mark>strncmp</mark>("foo", "fooey", <mark>5</mark>) &lt; 0) {
  NSLog(@"foo comes before fooey");
}
// prints "foo comes before fooey"</pre>
    <h2>Case Insensitive</h2>
    <p>
        In languages that have upper and lower case letters, you often need to 
        do a case insensitive comparisons.  The C standard library doesn't 
        define a case insensitive string comparison function, but one is part 
        of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX>POSIX</a> standard, 
        and most compiler vendors and operating systems include one.  The POSIX 
        version is called <code>strcasecmp()</code>.  Most modern Unix and 
        Linux systems (including iOS and Mac OS X) have 
        <code>strcasecmp()</code> available in the standard library.  Older 
        Unix systems and other operating systems may call this function 
        <code>stricmp()</code> or <code>strcmpi()</code>.  There is usually 
        also a length limited version called 
        <code>str<mark>n</mark>casecmp()</code> or 
        <code>str<mark>n</mark>icmp()</code>.
    <p>
        The case insensitive comparison functions usually compare only ASCII 
        characters, which limits their usefulness.
    <pre>// case insensitive comparison
char const *s = "&lt;HTML>&lt;HEAD>...";

if (strncasecmp(s, "&lt;html>", 6) == 0) {
  NSLog(@"looks like HTML");
}</pre>
    <h2>Encoding Issues</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>strcmp()</code> function was created in the era when most 
        computers used ASCII or other simple single byte encodings.  In ASCII, 
        there is only one byte sequence that represents any particular 
        character sequence.  This isn't true of many modern encodings, 
        including Unicode.  The Unicode character set contains both accented 
        characters such as "é" as well as a <em>combining</em> accent character 
        "´", so there are two ways to represent "é" in UTF-8 encoding:
    <table class=memory_map>
        <tr>
            <th>Address</th><th>64</th><th>65</th><th>66</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Character</td><td colspan=2>'é'</td><td class=blank></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Value</td><td>195</td><td>169</td><td class=blank></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Character</td><td>'e'</td><td colspan=2>'´'</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Value</td><td>101</td><td>204</td><td>129</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Obviously a lexicographic comparison function like <code>strcmp()</code>
         will not see these two strings as equivalent.  Accounting for this 
        requires performing 
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Normalization>normalization 
        on the Unicode characters</a> in the string before doing the 
        comparison.  Unicode has several different types of normalization, 
        which we won't dive into here.  If you need to do a lot of low level 
        processing of UTF-8 or other Unicode encoded text, you should look at 
        the <a href=https://icu.unicode.org>International Components for 
        Unicode</a>, a library of C functions for Unicode processing that is 
        included as part of iOS.  Better yet, in most cases you should use 
        <code>NSString</code>s when working with text.
    <h2><code>NSString</code> equality</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>NSString</code> class defines the 
        <code>-isEqualToString:</code> instance method for testing if an 
        <code>NSString</code> is equivalent to another <code>NSString</code>:
    <pre>// compare two NSStrings
NSString *s1 = @"foo";
NSString *s2 = @"bar";

if ( [s1 isEqualToString:s2] ) {
  NSLog(@"The strings are equivalent.");
}</pre>
    <p>
        You can also use the <code>-isEqual:</code> instance method defined by 
        <code>NSObject</code> to compare two <code>NSString</code>s, or to 
        compare an <code>NSString</code> with any other object:
    <pre>// compare two NSStrings using -isEqual:
NSString *s1 = @"foo";
NSString *s2 = @"bar";

if ( [s1 isEqual:s2] ) {
  NSLog(@"The strings are equivalent.");
}</pre>
    <p>
        The difference between the two methods is in their declarations.  The 
        <code>-isEqualToString:</code> method is only for comparing one 
        <code>NSString</code> to another; it's declaration looks like:
    <pre>// declaration of -isEqualToString:
- (BOOL)isEqualToString:(NSString *)aString</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>-isEqual:</code> method is for comparing any kind of 
        <code>NSObject</code> to another object; it's declaration looks like:
    <pre>// declaration of -isEqual:
- (BOOL)isEqual:(id)anObject</pre>
    <p>
        It's possible to use <code>-isEqual:</code> to compare an 
        <code>NSString</code> with an object of a different type, such as an 
        <code>NSNumber</code>:
    <pre>NSString *fiveString = @"5";
NSNumber *fiveNumber = [NSNumber numberWithInt:5];

if ( [fiveString isEqual:fiveNumber] ) {
  NSLog(@"fiveString equals fiveNumber");
} else {
  NSLog(@"Strings aren't equivalent to numbers, silly!");
}</pre>
    <p>
        You might hope that the <code>NSString</code> "5" is equivalent to the 
        <code>NSNumber</code> "5" but unfortunately they are not; the code 
        above will print out "Strings aren't equivalent to numbers, silly!".  
        In general, objects of different classes aren't considered to be 
        equivalent with one common exception: immutable classes like 
        <code>NSString</code> can be equivalent to their mutable subclasses 
        (<code>NSMutableString</code> in this case) and vice versa.
    <pre>NSString *fiveString = @"5";
NSMutableString *fiveMutableString = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@"5"];

if ( [fiveString isEqual:fiveMutableString] ) {
  NSLog(@"immutable and mutable strings can be equivalent");
}</pre>
    <p>
        And since <code>NSMutableString</code> is a subclass of 
        <code>NSString</code>, you can also use <code>-isEqualToString:</code> 
        to compare them:
    <pre>if ( [fiveString isEqualToString:fiveMutableString] ) {
  NSLog(@"immutable and mutable strings can be equivalent");
}</pre>
    <h2><code>-compare:</code></h2>
    <p>
        In addition to testing for equivalence using <code>-isEqual:</code> or 
        <code>-isEqualToString:</code>, you can also discover the relative 
        order of two <code>NSString</code> objects using the 
        <code>-compare:</code> family of methods.  The <code>-compare:</code> 
        method is very similar to the <code>strcmp()</code> method in C.  The 
        <code>-compare:</code> method returns a <code>NSComparisonResult</code> 
        value, which is simply an integer value.  Similar to 
        <code>strcmp()</code>, <code>-compare:</code> will return zero if the 
        two <code>NSString</code>s are equivalent, though you can also use the 
        constant <code>NSOrderedSame</code> instead of zero:
    <pre>// compare two NSStrings
NSString *s1 = @"foo";
NSString *s2 = @"bar";

if ( [s1 compare:s2] == NSOrderedSame] ) {
  NSLog(@"s1 is equivalent to s2");
} else {
  NSLog(@"s1 is not equivalent to s2");
}</pre>
    <p>
        Like <code>strcmp()</code>, if the receiver of the 
        <code>-compare:</code> message (the first <code>NSString</code>) comes 
        <em>before</em> the first argument (the second <code>NSString</code>), 
        negative one is returned; if the receiver comes <em>after</em> the 
        first argument, positive one is returned.  The constants 
        <code>NSOrderedAscending</code> and <code>NSOrderedDescending</code> 
        can be used instead of -1 and 1 respectively.
    <pre>// using NSComparisonResult

NSComparisonResult comparisonResult = [s1 compare:s2];
if (comparisonResult == NSOrderedAscending) {
  NSLog(@"s1 comes before s2");
} else if (comparisonResult == NSOrderedAscending) {
  NSLog(@"s1 comes after s2");
}</pre>
    <h2>Case Insensitive <code>-compare:</code></h2>
    <p>
        To test the equivalence of two <code>NSString</code> objects in a case 
        insensitive manner, use <code>-compare:options:</code> with the 
        <code>NSCaseInsensitiveSearch</code> flag.
    <pre>// case insensitive compare
NSString *s1 = @"foo";
NSString *s2 = @"FOO";

if ( [s1 compare:s2 options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch] == NSOrderedSame) {
  NSLog(@"s1 is equivalent to s2");
}</pre>
    <p>
        Since case insensitive comparison is a common operation, 
        <code>NSString</code> has a convenience method, 
        <code>-caseInsensitiveCompare:</code> which does the same thing.
    <pre>// case insensitive compare
NSString *s1 = @"foo";
NSString *s2 = @"FOO";

if ( [s1 caseInsensitiveCompare:s2] == NSOrderedSame) {
  NSLog(@"s1 is equivalent to s2");
}</pre>
    <h2>Unicode and <code>-compare:</code></h2>
    <p>
        By default, <code>NSString</code> is pretty smart about Unicode and 
        automatically understands things like Unicode combining characters.  
        For instance, you can represent é two ways, but <code>NSString</code> 
        knows that they represent equivalent strings:
    <pre>// comparing equivalent Unicode strings
NSString *eAcute = @"\u00e9";      // single character 'é'
NSString *ePlusAcute = @"e\u0301"; // 'e' + combining '´'

if ( [eAcute isEqualToString:ePlusAcute] ) {
  NSLog(@"'é' is equivalent to 'e' + '´'");
}</pre>
    <p>
        This can be surprising if you've only worked with ASCII or other single 
        byte encodings.  With <code>NSString</code>, you can't assume that 
        equivalent strings have the same length and character sequence.  
        Usually you don't care about the Unicode representation, but 
        occasionally it's important.  You can use the 
        <code>NSLiteralSearch</code> flag along with 
        <code>-compare:options:</code> to do a lexicographic comparison that 
        compares strings character value by character value.
    <pre>// lexicographic comparison of Unicode strings

if ( [eAcute compare:ePlusAcute options:NSLiteralSearch] != NSOrderedSame) {
  NSLog(@"'é' is not lexicographically equivalent to 'e' + '´'");
}</pre>
    <h2>combining options</h2>
    <p>
        The options constants used in the <code>-compare:options:</code> method 
        are bit flags.  You combine them using the bitwise or operator 
        (<code>|</code>).
    <pre>// using multiple options
NSString *eAcute = @"\u00e9";        // 'é'
NSString *capitalEAcute = @"\u00c9"; // 'É'

if ( [eAcute compare:capitalEAcute 
             options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch | NSLiteralSearch] 
         != NSOrderedSame) 
{
  NSLog(@"'é' is equivalent to 'É'");
}</pre>
    <h2>comparing substrings</h2>
    <p>
        If you only want to compare parts of two <code>NSString</code> objects, 
        you can use <code>-compare:options:range:</code> method and specify an 
        <code>NSRange</code> structure.  The <code>NSRange</code> structure is 
        composed of two parts: a starting location field named <code>loc</code> 
        and a length field named <code>len</code>.  Usually it's convenient to 
        use the <code>NSMakeRange()</code> function to generate the 
        <code>NSRange</code>.
    <pre>// compare substrings
NSString *s1 = @"foo";
NSString *s2 = @"fooey";

if ( [s1 compare:s2 
         options:0 
           range:MakeRange(0, 3)] == NSOrderedSame)
{
  NSLog(@"both strings start with 'foo'");
}</pre>
    <p>
        You pass in zero for the options to use the default comparison.  
        <code>-compare:options:range:</code> is similar to 
        <code>str<mark>n</mark>cmp()</code> with one important difference: the 
        <code>NSRange</code> you give must fall completely inside the receiver 
        (the first string) or an <code>NSRangeException</code> will be thrown.
    <h2>comparing using a specific locale</h2>
    <p>
        By default, the <code>-compare:</code> methods use the current locale 
        to determine the ordering of two strings.  The current locale is 
        controlled by the user when they set their language and region for 
        their iOS device.  Most of the time you should respect the user's 
        settings, but sometimes it's appropriate to compare strings using a 
        fixed locale.  Perhaps your app teaches French vocabulary and you want 
        your French word list to sort in standard French order whether the 
        user's phone is set to English, German or Japanese.  In French, 
        accented letters at the end of a word sort before accented letters 
        earlier in a word, thus "coté" should come before "côte".  If you use 
        the default locale, the result of comparing "coté" and "côte" varies 
        but will probably not give you the correct ordering.
    <pre>// compare using default locale
NSString *coteAcute = @"cot\u00e9";      // "coté"
NSString *coteCircumflex = @"c\u00f4te"; // "côte"

if ( [coteAcute compare:coteCircumflex] == NSOrderedAscending) {
  NSLog(@"Not using a French locale");
}</pre>
    <p>
        To remedy this, you can set the locale explicitly when you do your 
        comparison:
    <pre>// compare using specific locale
NSLocale *frenchLocale = [[[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifier:@"fr_FR"] autorelease];
NSComparisonResult comparisonResult = [coteAcute compare:coteCircumflex 
                                                 options:0 
                                                   range:NSMakeRange(0, 4)
                                                  locale:frenchLocale];
if (comparisonResult == NSOrderedDescending) {
  NSLog(@"Using a French locale");
}</pre>
    <p>
        That sums up the options for comparing C strings and 
        <code>NSString</code>s.  Next time, we'll look at
