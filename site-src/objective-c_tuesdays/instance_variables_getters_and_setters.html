    <h1>Instance Variables, Getters And Setters</h1>
    <p>
        Last time we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/instance_variables.html>instance 
        variables of Objective-C classes</a>.  Today we're going to look at 
        writing getters and setters for instance variables.
    <p>
        As we saw, instance variables have <em>protected</em> scope by default, 
        which makes them visible in instance methods of the class that defines 
        them and all subclasses, but hidden to all other code and classes by 
        default.  Hiding the inner workings of a class is a principal of object 
        oriented programming known as <em>encapsulation</em>.  In general, it's 
        better to 
        <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426154726/https://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask>tell 
        your objects what to do</a> rather than ask them for their data.  But 
        there are times when you need to get and set an object's data directly, 
        particularly for objects that correspond to those things your 
        application and users directly manipulate, like address book contacts 
        or cookie recipes.  The typical way to do this is to write 
        <em>getter</em> and <em>setter</em> methods.  Before Objective-C 2.0, 
        these were always written by hand, and there are still times when you 
        would want to write your own rather have the compiler generate them for 
        you using the <code>@property</code> and <code>@synthesize</code> 
        directives.
    <h2>Getters</h2>
    <p>
        A conventional getter method in Objective-C has the same name as the 
        instance variable:
    <pre>// getter method example
@interface CookieRecipe : NSObject {
  NSString *<mark>name</mark>;  // instance variable <mark>name</mark>
}
- (NSString *)<mark>name</mark>; // getter method for <mark>name</mark> ivar
@end

@implementation CookieRecipe

- (NSString *)<mark>name</mark> { // getter method for <mark>name</mark> ivar
  return <mark>name</mark>;
}

@end</pre>
    <p>
        This works because instance variables and instance methods live in 
        separate namespaces.  The compiler can always figure out whether you're 
        calling a method or accessing an instance variable, so there's never a 
        problem.  Getter methods are generally very simple and rarely have side 
        effects.
    <p>
        Compiler generated getters are as simple as the example above.  There 
        are two common cases where you might want to write them by hand: 
        calculated properties and defensive copying.
    <p>
        Sometimes a class has a property that's easily calculated from other 
        properties, such as a <code>fullName</code> property that can be 
        created on the fly by joining <code>firstName</code> and 
        <code>lastName</code>, or a <code>yearsWithCompany</code> property 
        that's calculated by subtracting <code>hireDate</code> from today's 
        date.  These types of properties are usually <em>read only</em> and 
        quick to calculate.
    <p>
        Defensive copying is done when your object has some mutable internal 
        data that it needs to share with other code, but which other code 
        should not change.  For example, you might have a <code>User</code> 
        class that has an <code>NSMutableArray</code> containing the user's 
        <code>friends</code>:
    <pre>// example of exposing mutable internals
@interface User : NSObject {
  NSMutableArray *<mark>friends</mark>; // contains other Users
}
- (NSMutableArray *)<mark>friends</mark>;
@end

@implementation User

- (NSMutableArray *)friends {
  return <mark>friends</mark>;
}

@end</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>friends</code> getter returns the <code>friends</code> 
        instance variable directly.  This might work out okay if all the code 
        that uses <code>friends</code> is polite and only reads the list of 
        friends.  But it's all to easy to innocently do something like this:
    <pre>// accidentally changing internal state

NSMutableArray *<mark>boneheads</mark> = [user friends]; 
// <mark>boneheads</mark> now points to same mutable array that 
// the friends instance variable does

NSPredicate *boneheadsOnly = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"species == 'Minbari'"];
[<mark>boneheads</mark> filterUsingPredicate: boneheadsOnly]; 
// oops! all the user's non-Minbari friends are gone
// -filterUsingPredicate: removes items that don't match</pre>
    <p>
        Mutable objects like <code>NSMutableArray</code> naturally have methods 
        like <code>-filterUsingPredicate:</code> that change the data they 
        contain.  By sharing a mutable instance variable directly, the 
        <code>User</code> class allows other code to intentionally or 
        unintentionally muck around with its internal state, breaking 
        encapsulation.  While bugs caused by unintentional mucking aren't 
        usually too hard to track down, it's the intentional mucking that 
        causes more trouble in the long run.  By exposing its internals like 
        this, the <code>User</code> class allows itself to become closely 
        coupled with the code that calls it, since callers can add or remove 
        items directly to or from the <code>friends</code> collection.  The 
        rules for adding and removing friends get spread around the app in 
        numerous locations rather than centralized in <code>User</code>, making 
        the system harder to understand, harder to change; small changes in 
        <code>User</code> then affect more of the code than necessary.
    <p>
        So rather than return a mutable internal value directly, there are a 
        couple of options in Objective-C.  When you're using a class like 
        <code>NSMutableArray</code> that has an immutable superclass, you can 
        <em>upcast</em> the returned instance variable to the immutable 
        superclass:
    <pre>// getter that upcasts to immutable superclass
@interface User : NSObject {
  <mark>NSMutableArray</mark> *friends; // instance variable is mutable
}
- (<mark>NSArray</mark> *)friends;
@end

@implementation User

// return type of getter is immutable
- (<mark>NSArray</mark> *)friends {
  return friends;
}

@end</pre>
    <p>
        It's called <em>upcasting</em> since it casts a subclass reference "up" 
        to a superclass reference.  Because this is always a safe cast, 
        Objective-C will do this automatically for you with no explicit cast is 
        needed.  While this won't prevent a malicious programmer from 
        downcasting the result back to its mutable type and mucking around, in 
        practice this works pretty well (and if you have a malicious programmer 
        on your team, you have a bigger problem than a little code can solve).
    <p>
        Sometimes the instance variable you want to share doesn't have an 
        immutable superclass, or most callers of the getter need to filter or 
        manipulate the returned value.  In that case, you can do an actual 
        defensive copy:
    <pre>// getter that does a defensive copy
@interface User : NSObject {
  <mark>NSMutableArray</mark> *friends; // instance variable is mutable
}
- (<mark>NSMutableArray</mark> *)friends;
@end

@implementation User

// return type of getter is mutable
- (<mark>NSMutableArray</mark> *)friends {
  // return an autoreleased copy
  return [[friends <mark>mutableCopy</mark>] <mark>autorelease</mark>];
}

@end</pre>
    <p>
        Now the caller can delete your friends all they want.  You can use 
        whichever creation or copy method is appropriate for the mutable data; 
        just make sure to properly <code>autorelease</code> the return value.
    <h2>Setters</h2>
    <p>
        The Objective-C convention for setter names is similar to Java's: 
        capitalize the instance variable name and prefix with <code>set</code>. 
         Setters come in different varieties, depending on the type of instance 
        variable.  The simplest kind is used for primitive types like 
        <code>int</code>s and object references that aren't retained, like 
        delegates.
    <pre>// assignment setter
- (void)setAge:(int)anAge {
  age = anAge;
}</pre>
    <p>
        Assignment setters are trivial, but the fun starts when you have to 
        deal with memory management and retain counts.  Here's an example of a 
        setter that retains the new value and releases the old one, but it has 
        a subtle bug:
    <pre>// retain setter WITH BUG
- (void)setAddress:(Address *)theAddress {
  [address release];             // release old address
  address = [theAddress retain]; // retain new address
}</pre>
    <p>
        This setter might never give you a problem, if you're lucky.  But what 
        happens if the new address and old address are the same object?  What 
        happens when that object's retain count is 1?
    <pre>// retain setter WITH BUG
// suppose <mark>address</mark> == <mark>theAddress</mark>
// and retain count is 1
- (void)setAddress:(Address *)theAddress { 
                                 // retain count is 1
  [address release];             // retain count now 0, 
                                 //     dealloc called
  address = [theAddress retain]; // oops! theAddress points at  
                                 //     invalid memory
}</pre>
    <p>
        There are two common ways to write a setter to get around this.  The 
        first way is to check for self-assignment:
    <pre>// retain setter with self-assignment check
- (void)setAddress:(Address *)theAddress {
  if (theAddress != address) {
    [address release];             // release old address
    address = [theAddress retain]; // retain new address
  }
}</pre>
    <p>
        The second way is to retain first and release last:
    <pre>// retain setter that retains first
- (void)setAddress:(Address *)theAddress {
  [theAddress retain];  // retain new address
  [address release];    // release old address
  address = theAddress;
}</pre>
    <p>
        This will prevent the retain count from going to zero in the case of 
        self-assignment.
    <p>
        Just as you may want to defensively copy in a getter, you may want to 
        do the same in a setter.  Here's an example a malicious programmer 
        would love:
    <pre>// be careful with that setter
@interface User : NSObject {
  NSString *name;
}
- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName;
@end

@implementation User

- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName {
  if (aName != name) {
    [name release];
    name = [aName retain];
  }
}

@end</pre>
    <p>
        Looks normal, right?  But what if I do this:
    <pre>// don't change that mutable object!
NSMutableString *someName = [@"Joe User" mutableCopy];

User user = // ...
[user setName: someName];
// okay cool, user's name is now "Joe User"

[someName appendString:@" Doodoo Head"];
// oops, user's name and someName point to the same object
// which now contains "Joe User Doodoo Head"</pre>
    <p>
        So even though you thought you were using an <em>immutable</em> 
        <code>NSString</code> for your user's name, many common Cocoa Touch 
        classes like <code>NSString</code> and <code>NSArray</code> have 
        <em>mutable</em> subclasses, and your object's callers can accidentally 
        give you a mutable instance that they modify later.  So when you're 
        writing setters in this situation, you should defensively copy the 
        value you receive.
    <pre>// setter that defensively copies

- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName {
  if (aName != name) {
    [name release];
    name = [<mark>aName copy</mark>];
  }
}</pre>
    <p>
        You can use the <code>-copy</code> method if the object implements the 
        <code>NSCopying</code> protocol, or any creation method that produces a 
        new independent object.  (Just make sure to retain that copy if 
        appropriate).
    <p>
        Next time, we'll look at how the 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/at-property_and_at-synthesize.html><code>@property</code>
         and <code>@synthesize</code> directives</a> are used in modern 
        Objective-C to generate getters and setters automatically.
