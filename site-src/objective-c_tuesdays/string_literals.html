    <h1>String Literals</h1>
    <p>
        Last time we started our new topic, strings, by looking at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/c_strings.html>memory organization and 
        character encodings of C strings</a>.  Today we'll look at C string and 
        <code>NSString</code> literals.
    <p>
        Most programs do string processing, or at least print out a status 
        message or two.  It's convenient to define some strings directly in the 
        program's code.  Since strings are really just lists of numbers, you 
        could certainly define your strings "by the numbers" using the raw 
        character codes:
    <pre>// what does this print out?
char message[7] = { 105, 80, 104, 111, 110, 101, 0 };
printf(message);</pre>
    <p>
        Geek points if you recognized that <code>message</code> is a null 
        terminated string.  Super ultra mega geek points if you can read what 
        it says (hint: it's ASCII).
    <p>
        So obviously writing the raw character codes isn't that convenient for 
        the programmer.  Since the compiler has to translate your code into 
        machine instructions anyway, it's a no-brainer to make it translate 
        strings into the correctly encoded bytes.  A string literal is a 
        representation of a string in your program that the compiler translates 
        into the corresponding character codes and stores in the program's data 
        section.  There are two kinds of string literals in Objective-C: plain 
        old C string literals and <code>NSString</code> literals.  They look 
        like this:
    <pre>// C string literal
char const *s1 = <mark>"Hello, world!"</mark>;

// NSString literal
NSString *s2 = <mark>@"Hello, world!"</mark>;</pre>
    <p>
        The double quote characters (") mark the beginning and the end of the 
        string literal.  <code>NSString</code> literals are prefixed with 
        <code>@</code> to distinguish them from C string literals.  It's 
        important not to mix the two up; they're not directly compatible.
    <h2>Line Breaks</h2>
    <p>
        String literals are not allowed to span multiple lines.  Actually, 
        that's not <em>exactly</em> true, so I'll illustrate what I mean; this 
        string is not a legal string literal:
    <pre>// not a legal string literal
char const *s1 = <mark>"Hello, world!
How are you?"</mark>;</pre>
    <p>
        Line breaks are not allowed inside the double quotes in a string 
        literal.  To include a line break, you use the new line (\n) <em>escape 
        sequence</em>.  We'll talk more about escape sequences below, but using 
        the new line escape sequence, the string literal becomes:
    <pre>// string literal containing a new line
char const *s1 = "Hello, world!<mark>\n</mark>How are you?";</pre>
    <p>
        Notice that the new line escape sequence takes the place of an actual 
        line break in the code.  When the compiler sees "\n" in a string 
        literal, it replaces it with ASCII character code 10, the line feed (or 
        new line) character.
    <p>
        But sometimes you don't want to add line breaks to your string literal, 
        but simply to break a long string literal across several lines to make 
        your code more readable.  One way is to use a backslash (\) before the 
        line break to tell the compiler to ignore the line break; this is often 
        used to format long preprocessor macros.  These two string literals are 
        identical:
    <pre>char const *error1 = "Unable to complete request: please wait a few minutes and try again.";

char const *error2 = "Unable to complete request: <mark>\</mark>
please wait a few minutes and try again.";</pre>
    <p>
        This works for <code>NSString</code> literals also, but note that any 
        leading space in the continuation line will be interpreted as part of 
        the string.  Also note that the backslash (\) must be directly before 
        the line break in the code; if you have any space or tab characters 
        between the backslash and the line break, the compiler will complain.
    <p>
        A better way to do this is by simply breaking the string literal into 
        two or more string literals that are separated only by whitespace.  The 
        following two string literals are identical:
    <pre>char const *error1 = "Unable to complete request: please wait a few minutes and try again.";

char const *error2 = "Unable to complete request: <mark>"</mark>
                     <mark>"</mark>please wait a few minutes and try again.";</pre>
    <p>
        This also works for <code>NSString</code> literals; only the first part 
        of an <code>NSString</code> literal is prefixed with <code>@</code>:
    <pre>NSString *error1 = @"Unable to complete request: please wait a few minutes and try again.";

NSString *error2 = @"Unable to complete request: <mark>"</mark>
                    <mark>"</mark>please wait a few minutes and try again.";</pre>
    <p>
        Only spaces, tabs and line breaks are allowed between sections of a 
        string literal.  If the string is supposed to have a line break at the 
        end of each section, you need to add new line escapes:
    <pre>char const *error_page = 
  "&lt;html>\n"
  "  &lt;head>&lt;title>404 Not Found&lt;/title>&lt;/head>\n"
  "  &lt;body>\n"
  "    &lt;h1>404 Not Found&lt;/h1>\n"
  "  &lt;/body>\n"
  "&lt;/html>\n";</pre>
    <h2>Escape Sequences</h2>
    <p>
        There are other escape sequences like the new line (\n) escape 
        sequence.  The most commonly used ones are:
    <table class=data_table>
        <tr>
            <th>escape sequence</th><th>name</th><th>ASCII value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>\n</code></td><td>new line or line feed</td><td>10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>\r</code></td><td>carriage return</td><td>13</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>\t</code></td><td>tab</td><td>9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>\"</code></td><td>double quote</td><td>34</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>\\</code></td><td>backslash</td><td>92</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Each of these escape sequences requires two characters in the string 
        literal, but becomes only one character in the string when the program 
        is compiled.
    <h2>Octal Escape Sequences</h2>
    <p>
        If you wish to specify an arbitrary byte value in a string literal, you 
        can use an <em>octal escape sequence</em>.  Octal escape sequences 
        begin with a backslash (\) like normal escapes, but the backslash is 
        followed by an octal (base 8) number instead of a letter or punctuation 
        mark.
    <pre>// octal escape sequence examples
char const *bell = "\7";  // ASCII code 7 (bell)
char const *bs = "\10";   // ASCII code 8 (backspace)
char const *del = "\177"; // ASCII code 127 (delete)</pre>
    <p>
        The octal numbers in escape sequences are limited to three digits; you 
        can pad short octal numbers with leading zeros:
    <pre>char const *bell = "\007";</pre>
    <p>
        which is handy to format a long sequence of octal escapes.  Also note 
        that octal numbers must be between 0 and 255.  Octal escapes greater 
        than 255 (377 octal) will be interpreted in a surprising way:
    <pre>// max octal value is 377 (255 decimal)
char const *two55 = "\377";
NSLog(@"length = %u", strlen(two55));
NSLog(@"first char = %u", (unsigned char)two55[0]);
// prints: 
//   length = 1
//   first char = 255

// octal value of 378 (256 decimal) isn't a valid escape
char const *two56 = "\378";
NSLog(@"length = %u", strlen(two56));
NSLog(@"first char = %u", (unsigned char)two56[0]);
NSLog(@"second char = %u", (unsigned char)two56[1]);
// prints:
//   length = 2
//   first char = 31 <em>(octal 37)</em>
//   second char = 56 <em>(ASCII code for '8')</em></pre>
    <p>
        Because the compiler will try to read up to three octal digits, an 
        octal escape with fewer than three digits can sometimes have an 
        unexpected interpretation.  For example, embedding a form feed 
        character (ASCII code 12, octal 14) at the start of this string 
        produces the expected string:
    <pre>char const *heading = "\14Preface";

NSLog(@"first char = %u", (unsigned char)title[0]);
NSLog(@"second char = %u", (unsigned char)title[1]);
// prints:
//   first char = 12 <em>(form feed, octal value 14)</em>
//   second char = 80 <em>(ASCII code for 'P')</em></pre>
    <p>
        But if the character directly after '\14' is a valid octal digit, the 
        compiler produces something unintended:
    <pre>char const *heading = "\141. Introduction";

NSLog(@"first char = %u", (unsigned char)title[0]);
NSLog(@"second char = %u", (unsigned char)title[1]);
// prints:
//   first char = 97 <em>(octal value 141)</em>
//   second char = 46 <em>(ASCII code for '.')</em></pre>
    <p>
        The heading number '1' is a valid octal digit, so the compiler assumes 
        it's part of the octal escape.  There are several ways to prevent this. 
         You can use an escape sequence to specify the ambiguous character, 
        break the string into parts, or simply pad the octal number with 
        leading zeros.
    <pre>// dealing with ambiguous octal escapes

// replace possible octal characters with escapes
char const *heading1 = "\14\61. Introduction"; // '\61' is octal escape for '1'

// pad octal escape to three digits
char const *heading2 = "\0141. Introduction"; // unambiguous

// break string into parts
char const *heading3 = "\14" "1. Introduction"; // easier to read</pre>
    <h2>Hexadecimal Escape Sequences</h2>
    <p>
        Hexadecimal numbers can also be used in escape sequences to specify an 
        arbitrary byte value.  Hexadecimal escape sequences begin with a 
        backslash (\) followed by 'x' and one or more hexadecimal (base 16) 
        numbers.  Note that the 'x' must be lower case.  Like octal escapes, 
        you can pad hexadecimal escapes with leading zeros.
    <pre>// hexadecimal escape sequence examples
char const *tab = "\x09";    // ASCII code 9 (horizontal tab)
char const *newline = "\xA"; // ASCII code 10 (new line/line feed)
char const *del = "\x7f";    // ASCII code 127 (delete)</pre>
    <p>
        The upper hexadecimal digits (represented by A through F) can be upper 
        or lower case.
    <p>
        Like octal escapes, hexadecimal escapes have a gotcha: the compiler 
        will interpret every valid hex digit after the "\x" as part of the 
        hexadecimal escape.  For example, embedding a form feed character 
        (ASCII code 12) at the start of this string works as expected:
    <pre>char const *title = "\xcThe C Language";

NSLog(@"first char = %u", (unsigned char)title[0]);
NSLog(@"second char = %u", (unsigned char)title[1]);
// prints:
//   first char = 12 <em>(form feed, hex value c)</em>
//   second char = 84 <em>(ASCII code for 'T')</em></pre>
    <p>
        Since 'T' isn't a valid hex digit, the compiler figures out that the 
        first character is '\xc'.  The following string doesn't work as 
        expected:
    <pre>char const *title = "\xcC Language Primer";

NSLog(@"first char = %u", (unsigned char)title[0]);
NSLog(@"second char = %u", (unsigned char)title[1]);
// prints:
//   first char = 204 <em>(hex value cc)</em>
//   second char = 32 <em>(ASCII code for space)</em></pre>
    <p>
        Since 'C' is a valid hex digit, the compiler sees the first character 
        as '\xcC' (cc in hex, 204 in decimal) and the second character as the 
        space after the 'C'.  To prevent this, you can replace any ambiguous 
        character with an escape sequence, or better yet simply break the 
        string into parts.
    <pre>// dealing with ambiguous hexadecimal escapes

// replace possible hex characters with escapes
char const *title1 = "\xc\103 Language Primer"; // '\103' is octal escape for 'C'

// break string into parts
char const *title2 = "\xc" "C Language Primer"; // much easier to read</pre>
    <p>
        As in octal escapes, the hexadecimal number in a hexadecimal escape is 
        limited to the range of 0 through 255.  If you specify a hexadecimal 
        escape sequence larger than 255, the compiler will emit a "hex escape 
        sequence out of range" warning.
