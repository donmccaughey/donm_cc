    <h1>Wide Character Strings</h1>
    <p>
        Last week we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/unicode_string_literals.html>Unicode 
        escape sequences</a> in C string and <code>NSString</code> literal.  
        Today we'll take a quick overview of <em>wide character strings</em> 
        and talk about where they fit into the iOS development.
    <p>
        When the C language was developed in the early 1970's, little thought 
        was given to representing non-English languages.  By default, most C 
        compilers assumed that both code files and application output used 
        7-bit ASCII encoding and that each logical character in a string fit 
        into a single 8-bit byte or <code>char</code> value.  By the time C was 
        first standardized by ANSI in 1989 (and by ISO in 1990), the need to 
        handle many more characters than ASCII was obvious, but the Unicode 
        standard was still nascent.  So the ANSI C committee included a wide 
        character type and wide character string functions in the C89 standard, 
        but didn't tie wide character support to any specific character 
        encoding scheme.
    <h2><code>wchar_t</code></h2>
    <p>
        C89 introduced a new integer type, <code>wchar_t</code>.  This is 
        similar to a <code>char</code>, but typically "wider".  On many 
        systems, including Windows, a <code>wchar_t</code> is 16 bits.  This is 
        typical of systems that implemented their Unicode support using earlier 
        versions of the Unicode standard, which originally defined fewer than 
        65,535 characters.  Unicode was later expanded to support historical 
        and special purpose character sets, so on some systems, including Mac 
        OS X and iOS, the <code>wchar_t</code> type is 32 bits in size.  This 
        is often poorly documented, but you can use a simple test like this to 
        find out:
    <pre>// how big is wchar_t?
NSLog(@"wchar_t is %u bits wide", 8 * sizeof(wchar_t));</pre>
    <p>
        On a Mac or iPhone, this will print "wchar_t is 32 bits wide".  
        Additionally, <code>wchar_t</code> is a <code>typedef</code> for 
        another integer type in C.  In C++, <code>wchar_t</code> is a built-in 
        integer type.  In practice, this means you need to <code>#include 
        &lt;wchar.h></code> in C when using wide characters.
    <h2>signed or unsigned?</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>char</code> integer type is almost always a signed integer 
        with a range from -128 to 127.  You can use the <code>CHAR_MIN</code> 
        and <code>CHAR_MAX</code> constants defined in 
        <code>&lt;limits.h></code> to find out the range for a particular 
        compiler:
    <pre>NSLog(@"CHAR_MIN = %0.f", (double)CHAR_MIN);
NSLog(@"CHAR_MAX = %0.f", (double)CHAR_MIN);</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>wchar_t</code> type can be signed or unsigned.  The 
        <code>WCHAR_MIN</code> and <code>WCHAR_MAX</code> constants hold the 
        range of a <code>wchar_t</code> and are defined in both 
        <code>&lt;wchar.h></code> and <code>&lt;stdint.h></code>.
    <pre>NSLog(@"WCHAR_MIN = %0.f", (double)WCHAR_MIN);
NSLog(@"WCHAR_MAX = %0.f", (double)WCHAR_MIN);</pre>
    <p>
        On Windows, <code>wchar_t</code> is an unsigned 16-bit integer.  On Mac 
        and iPhone, <code>wchar_t</code> is a <em>signed</em> 32-bit integer, 
        so the code above will print out "WCHAR_MAX = 2147483647" and 
        "WCHAR_MIN = -2147483648".  For the most part you don't need to worry 
        about whether <code>wchar_t</code> is signed or unsigned; it only 
        becomes important if you need to do comparisons and operations that mix 
        <code>wchar_t</code> with other integer types (a rarity).
    <h2>wide character literals</h2>
    <p>
        We looked at <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/string_literals.html>C 
        string literals</a> in previous entries.  Wide character string 
        literals are very similar, but are prefixed with 'L':
    <pre>// example of a wide character string literal
wchar_t const *s = L"foobarf!";</pre>
    <p>
        Like C string literals, wide strings separated by only whitespace are 
        considered one logical string:
    <pre>// wide strings written in segments
wchar_t const *s1 = L"foo" "bar";
wchar_t const *s2 = L"Hello, " L"world!";</pre>
    <h2>wide character functions</h2>
    <p>
        Most string functions in the standard C library are defined in the 
        <code>&lt;string.h></code> header.  A very similar set of functions for 
        wide character strings are defined in <code>&lt;wchar.h></code>.  The 
        functions follow a similar naming convention.  Where string functions 
        are prefixed with <code>str</code>, the wide character equivalents are 
        prefixed with <code>wcs</code> (for <mark>w</mark>ide 
        <mark>c</mark>haracter <mark>s</mark>tring).  So the 
        <code>strlen()</code> function calculates the length of a string and 
        the corresponding <code>wcslen()</code> function calculates the length 
        of a wide character string.
    <h2>not used much</h2>
    <p>
        In practice, you won't use wide character strings very often in 
        Objective-C since the <code>NSString</code> class does just about 
        everything wide character strings are meant to do, but you may 
        occasionally run across them in other C libraries.
    <p>
        Next time, we'll begin looking at common string operations using C 
        strings and <code>NSString</code>s, starting with 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/concatenating_strings.html>string 
        concatenation</a>.
