    <h1>Changing Default Property Names</h1>
    <p>
        Last week we looked at declaring 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/atomic_and_nonatomic_properties.html>atomic 
        and nonatomic properties</a>.  I promised to talk about 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/writing_a_thread_safe_getter_method.html>writing 
        a thread safe getter</a> this week, but I'm pressed for time today so 
        I'm going to shoe horn in another short topic instead.
    <p>
        When you declare a property in a class, the getter has the same name as 
        the property, while the setter is the capitalized property name with 
        <code>set</code> prepended.  For illustration, here is a 
        <code>User</code> class with a property named <code>active</code>:
    <pre>@interface User : NSObject {
  BOOL active;
}
@property BOOL active;

@end


@implementation User

@synthesize active;

@end</pre>
    <p>
        The compiler will generate a getter method named <code>active</code> 
        and a setter method named <code>setActive</code>.  Sometimes the 
        default method names aren't exactly what you want; for instance, it's a 
        common convention that getters for <code>BOOL</code> properties be 
        prefixed with <code>is</code>.  In the case of our <code>User</code> 
        class, we would like to have the getter named <code>isActive</code>.
    <p>
        The <code>@property</code> directive has two attributes to do just 
        this: <code>getter=<em>name</em></code> and 
        <code>setter=<em>name</em></code>.  Just like the other attributes of 
        <code>@property</code>, <code>getter</code> and <code>setter</code> are 
        placed in parentheses after the <code>@property</code> directive and 
        before the property type and name.  So the <code>active</code> property 
        in our example would look like:
    <pre>@interface User : NSObject {
  BOOL active;
}
@property (<mark>getter=isActive</mark>) BOOL active;

@end

@implementation User

@synthesize active;

@end</pre>
    <p>
        And usage the <code>active</code> property now looks like:
    <pre>// example use of isActive getter
User *user = [[User alloc] init];

// getter/setter called as methods
if ( ! [user <mark>isActive</mark>] ) {
  [user <mark>setActive:</mark>YES];
}

// getter/setter called with dot syntax
if (user.<mark>isActive</mark>) {
  user.<mark>active</mark> = NO;
}</pre>
    <p>
        We'll take a closer look at dot syntax in the near future, but 
        basically when the compiler sees code like this:
    <pre>if ( <mark>user.isActive</mark> ) {
  <mark>user.active = NO</mark>;
}</pre>
    <p>
        it translates it into this:
    <pre>if ( <mark>[user isActive]</mark> ) {
  <mark>[user setActive:NO]</mark>;
}</pre>
    <p>
        Dot syntax is complementary to properties, but is separate and unaware 
        of them.  When translating a setter call in dot syntax to the 
        corresponding method call, the compiler always looks for a method 
        beginning with <code>set</code>.  If you change your setter name to 
        something different, you'll see a compiler error like
    <pre>object cannot be set - either readonly property or no setter found</pre>
    <p>
        or
    <pre>request for member '<em>setter name</em>' in something not a structure or union</pre>
    <p>
        if you call it using dot syntax.  So if we rename the setter for the 
        <code>active</code> property to <code>makeActive</code> instead of the 
        default <code>setActive</code>:
    <pre>@interface User : NSObject {
  BOOL active;
}
@property (getter=isActive, <mark>setter=makeActive</mark>) BOOL active;

@end</pre>
    <p>
        then using method call syntax, we can now do this:
    <pre>if ( [user isActive] ) {
  <mark>[user <mark>makeActive:</mark>NO]</mark>;
}</pre>
    <p>
        but because the compiler expects setters to begin with 
        <code>set</code>, using dot syntax generates an error:
    <pre>if (user.isActive) {
  <mark>user.<mark>makeActive</mark> = NO</mark>; // ERROR: request for member 'makeActive' 
                               // in something not a structure or union
}</pre>
    <p>
        In general you should follow the standard conventions and use the 
        default getter and setter names; it's less work for you and your code 
        is easier for others to understand.
    <p>
        Next week, we'll look at the 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/writing_a_thread_safe_getter_method.html>thread 
        safety of getters</a> that return retained objects.
