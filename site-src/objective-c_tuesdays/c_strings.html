    <h1>C Strings</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the start of a new topic: <em>strings</em>.  We'll cover 
        both plain old C strings as well as the much nicer 
        <code>NSString</code>s of Objective-C (and their <code>CFString</code> 
        siblings).  Today we start at the beginning with C strings.
    <p>
        C strings are also called null (or nul) terminated strings, zero 
        terminated strings or sometimes z-strings.  A C string is simply a 
        block of memory where bytes represent characters.  The last byte in the 
        block contains a zero value (the nul character) to mark the end of the 
        string.
    <p>
        Here is the memory layout of the string "iPhone" in ASCII encoding.  
        The string starts at memory address 48:
    <table class=memory_map>
        <tr>
                 <th>Address</th>     <th>48</th>     <th>49</th>     <th>50</th>     <th>51</th>     <th>52</th>     <th>53</th>     <th>54</th>   
        </tr>
        <tr>
                 <td>Value</td>     <td>105</td>     <td>80</td>     <td>104</td>     <td>111</td>     <td>110</td>     <td>101</td>     <td>0</td>   
        </tr>
        <tr>
                 <td>Character</td>     <td>'i'</td>     <td>'P'</td>     <td>'h'</td>     <td>'o'</td>     <td>'n'</td>     <td>'e'</td>     <td>'\0'</td>   
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Notice that "iPhone" is six characters long but uses seven bytes of 
        memory, since it has a zero value after the last character to mark the 
        end of the string.  Functions that work with C strings depend on the 
        zero terminator being there to know how long the string is.  Forgetting 
        to write a zero at the end, or overwriting it by accident is a common 
        programming error when working with C strings.   This is a type of 
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow><em>buffer 
        overrun</em></a> error that can lead to security breaches and program 
        crashes.
    <p>
        Since C strings are just memory blocks, you declare C string variables 
        as pointers to type <code>char</code> for mutable C strings or type 
        <code>const char</code> or <code>char const</code> for constant 
        (immutable) C strings.  (The <code>const</code> has the same meaning 
        before or directly after the <code>char</code>.)
    <pre>// example C string variable declarations
char *mutable_c_string;
const char *immutable_c_string1;
char const *immutable_c_string2;</pre>
    <p>
        Since C string literals are immutable, variables that point to literals 
        should be declared <code>const</code>, or the compiler will complain:
    <pre>char const *string1 = "foobar"; // okay
char *string2 = "barfoo";       // WARNING! should be const</pre>
    <p>
        When you need some temporary storage to receive a C string, it's common 
        to declare a <code>char</code> array.
    <pre>char buffer[81];
sprintf(buffer, "The answer is %d\n", 42);</pre>
    <p>
        Here we use the <code>sprintf()</code> function to write formatted data 
        to a string that's placed in <code>buffer</code>.
    <p>
        You may also sometimes see a C string declared like this:
    <pre>char const name[] = "foo";</pre>
    <p>
        This is almost the same as:
    <pre>char const *name = "foo";</pre>
    <p>
        There's a subtle and mostly unimportant difference between these two 
        declarations.  The first one declares an array, the second one declares 
        a pointer to an array.  We'll look at the difference between these two 
        in the future when we cover arrays. 
    <h2>Character Encodings</h2>
    <p>
        C doesn't mandate any specific character encoding for strings.  C 
        strings frequently contain single byte encodings like ASCII or 
        ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1).  In a single byte encoding, each byte in the C 
        string corresponds to a character, and the encoding defines 256 
        characters (or fewer -- some byte values may not be valid characters).  
        C strings can also contain multibyte encodings such as UTF-8 or Shift 
        JIS where some characters are represented by two or more bytes.  It's 
        up to the application programmer to keep track of character encoding 
        issues when using C strings.
    <p>
        Most encodings used today are ASCII compatible, meaning that character 
        values from zero to 127 represent the same characters defined by the 
        ASCII encoding.  If your program only ever processes ASCII text, you're 
        in luck: you can ignore most encoding issues (at least until some pesky 
        user decides to enter "San José" or "Björk").  In the real world, 
        people use many more characters than the measly 128 in the ASCII set, 
        so it's necessary to pay a little attention to character encodings when 
        working with C strings.  When you have mismatched encodings, you get 
        data corruption and unhappy users.
    <p>
        For example, here is the word "Γεεκ" ("Geek" in Greek letters) at 
        memory address 64 using the 
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-7>ISO-8859-7 single 
        byte encoding</a>:
    <table class=memory_map>
        <tr>
                 <th>Address</th>     <th>64</th>     <th>65</th>     <th>66</th>     <th>67</th>     <th>68</th>   
        </tr>
        <tr>
                 <td>Value</td>     <td>195</td>     <td>229</td>     <td>229</td>     <td>234</td>     <td>0</td>   
        </tr>
        <tr>
                 <td>Character</td>     <td>'Γ'</td>     <td>'ε'</td>     <td>'ε'</td>     <td>'κ'</td>     <td>'\0'</td>   
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        And here is the word "Γεεκ" at memory address 64 using the multibyte 
        UTF-8 encoding:
    <table class=memory_map>
        <tr>
                 <th>Address</th>     <th>64</th>     <th>65</th>     <th>66</th>     <th>67</th>     <th>68</th>     <th>69</th>     <th>70</th>     <th>71</th>     <th>72</th>   
        </tr>
        <tr>
                 <td>Value</td>     <td>206</td>     <td>147</td>     <td>206</td>     <td>181</td>     <td>206</td>     <td>181</td>     <td>206</td>     <td>186</td>     <td>0</td>   
        </tr>
        <tr>
                 <td>Character</td>     <td colspan=2>'Γ'</td>     <td colspan=2>'ε'</td>     <td colspan=2>'ε'</td>     <td colspan=2>'κ'</td>     <td>'\0'</td>   
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Even though they represent the same text, the two strings have very 
        different representations in memory.  If you fed one string into a 
        function expecting the other encoding, you would get an error at best.  
        Data corruption would be the usual result.
    <h2>Converting Between Encodings</h2>
    <p>
        The standard C library doesn't provide support for converting between 
        encodings.  On modern Unix and Unix-derived systems, the 
        <a href=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/iconv.3.html><code>iconv()</code></a>
         function is commonly used to convert between encodings.  Objective-C 
        programs usually use the facilities provided by <code>NSString</code> 
        or <code>CFString</code>.  Since <code>NSString</code> and 
        <code>CFString</code> objects are represented internally as Unicode, 
        they can store text from any encoding.  To translate a C string to an 
        <code>NSString</code>:
    <pre>char const *c_string = "foobar";
NSString *ns_string = [NSString stringWithCString:c_string 
                                encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];</pre>
    <p>
        And to translate an <code>NSString</code> to a C string:
    <pre>NSString *ns_string = @"foobar";
NSData *c_string_data = [ns_string dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
char const *c_string = c_string_data.bytes;</pre>
    <p>
        When converting to a C string, the <code>-dataUsingEncoding:</code> 
        method returns an <code>NSData</code> object to manage the memory that 
        needs to be allocated for the C string.  You simply use the 
        <code>-bytes</code> method to retrieve the C string pointer.
    <p>
        If you're using the UTF-8 encoding, you can do this in one step using 
        the convenience method <code>-UTF8String</code>.
    <pre>char const *c_string = ns_string.UTF8String;</pre>
    <p>
        Note that this is just a short cut for calling 
        <code>-dataUsingEncoding:</code> with the 
        <code>NSUTF8StringEncoding</code>; the returned C string lives in an 
        autoreleased <code>NSData</code> object.  (This is great if you just 
        need to pass a C string along to a C function, but you'll need to copy 
        the returned C string if you want to keep it around.)
    <p>
        Core Foundation provides similar C functions.  You use <code> 
        CFStringCreateWithCString()</code> to create a <code>CFString</code> 
        from a C string:
    <pre>char const *c_string = "foobar";
CFStringRef cf_string = CFStringCreateWithCString(kCFAllocatorDefault, c_string, kCFStringEncodingASCII);</pre>
    <p>
        Converting from a <code>CFString</code> to a C string requires that you 
        provide a buffer to receive the converted C string.
    <pre>CFStringRef cf_string = (CFStringRef)@"foobar";
char buffer[7];
Boolean result = CFStringGetCString(cf_string, buffer, 7, kCFStringEncodingASCII);
if (result == true) {
  // ... conversion succeeded, okay to use string in buffer
  printf("%s\n", buffer);
}</pre>
    <p>
        There's a lot more to cover.  Computers may be all about numbers, but 
        it seems to me that programming is 90% text processing.  Next time, 
        we'll look at <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/string_literals.html>C 
        string literals and <code>NSString</code> literals</a>.
