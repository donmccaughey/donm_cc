### Able Pear Software

Burlingame, CA

Founder and Principal Developer

I ran a small software development firm focused on mobile apps.  Interesting
projects included:

- **Square**, 2012 - _iPad integration with point-of-sale (POS) hardware_
  Built an iOS library linking the Square POS app with the Square Stand.
  Worked with the app team and embedded software team to create APIs and
  communication protocols.  Built engineering test applications.
- **BMW**, 2009-2010 - _first iPhone integration for the [BMW Mini][2]_
  Starting with BMW's prototype iPhone app that used HTTP to connect to the
  [automotive head unit][3], I designed and implemented a unique proxy to
  direct HTTP connections from the app to the head unit over the phone's 30 pin
  connector.  Worked with embedded engineers to design a communication
  protocol.  Built a C++ echo server running on the head unit to diagnose
  intermittent data corruption.  Implemented simple flow control to work around
  deficiencies in the underlying [iAP protocol][4].
