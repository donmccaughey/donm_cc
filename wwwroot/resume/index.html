    <p>
        I'm a software engineer with strong technical, leadership and
        organizational skills.  After several years adding people management to
        my skill set, I'm looking to have impact through technical leadership,
        system design and hands-on coding.

                <li>
                     Doubled the team to 15 engineers, hiring across all
                    experience levels.

                     Guided the team through delivery of key features that moved
                    the business forward, including our external API and SDKs,
                    SSO for customers, improved internal tools for our 80+

        </ul>
        <p>
            I ran a small software development firm focused on mobile apps.
            Interesting projects included:
            <ul>
                <li class=project>
                    <strong>Square</strong>, 2012 — <em>iPad integration with
                    point-of-sale (POS) hardware</em><br>
                     Built an iOS library
                    linking the Square POS app with the Square Stand.  Worked
                    with the app team and embedded software team to create APIs
                    and communication protocols.  Built test applications used
                    by the hardware and software teams.
                <li class=project>
                    <strong>Facebook, Skype, Pivotal Labs</strong>, 2011 —
                    <em>Skype app for unreleased phone</em><br>
                     Created a Skype
                    client for a mobile OS built on an Android core.  Worked
                    with Skype engineers to integrate the Skype client library.
                    Worked with Facebook engineers to integrate with the
                    device's HTML and JavaScript user interface.
                <li class=project>
                    <strong>BMW</strong>, 2009-2010 — <em>first iPhone
                    integration for the
                    <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1519458349>BMW
                    Mini</a></em><br>
                     Starting with BMW's prototype iPhone app
                    that used HTTP to connect to the
                    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_head_unit>automotive
                    head unit</a>, I designed and implemented a unique proxy to
                    direct HTTP connections from the app to the head unit over
                    the phone's 30 pin connector.  Worked with embedded
                    engineers to design a communication protocol.  Built a C++
                    echo server running on the head unit to diagnose
                    intermittent data corruption.  Implemented simple flow
                    control to work around deficiencies in the underlying
