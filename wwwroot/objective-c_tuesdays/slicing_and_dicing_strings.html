    <h1>Slicing And Dicing Strings</h1>
    <p>
        Last time, we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/string_comparison_and_equality.html>C 
        string and <code>NSString</code> comparison and equality</a>.  Today 
        we'll examine functions and methods for creating substrings of C 
        strings and <code>NSString</code>s.
    <h2>Substrings of C strings</h2>
    <p>
        Creating a C string requires you to explicitly manage the memory the 
        string lives in.  Depending on how long you need to keep the C string 
        around, you can use either a fixed buffer or a dynamically allocated 
        one.  As always with C strings, you need to be careful not to write 
        past the end of the buffer.
    <p>
        Creating a substring that starts at the beginning of the source string 
        is straight forward: use the <code>str<mark>n</mark>cpy()</code> 
        function.  There's a big gotcha when using <code>strncpy()</code> to 
        copy a substring: it doesn't automatically add a null terminator to the 
        destination.  Here's an example of copying the first three characters 
        of a C string into a fixed buffer:
    <pre>// copy substring from start of source
// using a fixed buffer
char const *source = "foobar";
char buffer[4];                // make sure buffer includes
                               // space for null terminator

strncpy(buffer, source, 3);    // copy first 3 chars from source
buffer[3] = '\0';              // remember to add null terminator</pre>
    <p>
        Using a dynamic buffer is similar, but requires explicit memory 
        management.
    <pre>// copy substring from start of source
// using a dynamic buffer
char const *source = "foobar";
char *buffer = malloc(4 * sizeof(char)); // make sure buffer includes
                                         // space for null terminator

if ( ! buffer) {
  // must handle allocation failure
}

strncpy(buffer, source, 3); // copy first 3 chars from source
buffer[3] = '\0';           // remember to add null terminator

// use buffer ...

// don't forget to free() buffer when done
free(buffer);</pre>
    <p>
        You can make this a little more compact by using <code>calloc()</code> 
        instead of <code>malloc()</code>.  The <code>calloc()</code> function 
        allocates memory using <code>malloc()</code>, then clears all the bytes 
        to zero.  As long as you make sure to include an extra byte at the end, 
        your new substring will be null terminated:
    <pre>// copy substring from start of source
// using a dynamic buffer 
// allocated with calloc()
char const *source = "foobar";
char *buffer = calloc(4, sizeof(char)); // make sure buffer includes
                                        // space for null terminator

if ( ! buffer) {
  // handle allocation failure
}

strncpy(buffer, source, 3); // copy first 3 chars from source
                            // last char in buffer is already '/0'

// use buffer ...

// don't forget to free() buffer when done
free(buffer);</pre>
    <p>
        There's not a huge difference between <code>malloc()</code> and 
        <code>calloc()</code>, so choose whichever one you're more used to 
        using, or use <code>calloc()</code> if you don't have a strong 
        preference.  The cost of clearing a range of memory to zeros is so tiny 
        as to not be worth considering in most circumstances, and knowing that 
        your buffer is initialized to zeros can be handy.
    <p>
        There's no standard C function for getting a substring that starts 
        somewhere in the middle of the source string, because one isn't needed 
        -- you simply move the pointer from the start of the string.  Here's an 
        illustration:
    <pre>// C strings are pointers
char const *string = "foobar";

NSLog(@"'%s'", string);
// prints out 'foobar'

char const *substring = string + 3;
NSLog(@"'%s'", substring);
// prints out 'bar'</pre>
    <p>
        You can add an integer value to the C string pointer to get a pointer 
        to the middle of the source string -- just be careful not to go off the 
        end of the string!  If you only need the substring for a short period 
        of time, or if you know that the source string will live longer than 
        the substring and never change, it's safe to simply create a substring 
        this way.  However, you can introduce weird bugs if you get this wrong. 
         When in doubt, copy the substring to a new buffer:
    <pre>// create a substring from the middle of a string
char const *source = "foobar";
char const *substringSource = source + 3;
size_t charCount = strlen(substringSource) + 1;
char *buffer = calloc(charCount, sizeof(char));

if ( ! buffer) {
  // handle allocation failure
}

strcpy(buffer, substringSource);

// use buffer ...

free(buffer);</pre>
    <p>
        Here we calculate the starting point by simply adding <code>3</code> to 
        the string pointer <code>source</code>.  Then we figure out the number 
        of <code>char</code>s we need to allocate using the 
        <code>strlen()</code> function, remembering to add <code>1</code> for 
        the null terminator character.  After allocating memory, the 
        <code>strcpy()</code> function copies all the characters from 
        <code>substringSource</code> into <code>buffer</code>.  Unlike 
        <code>str<mark>n</mark>cpy()</code>, <code>strcpy()</code> will copy 
        the null terminator, so this code will be the same whether we use 
        <code>calloc()</code> or <code>malloc()</code> to allocate the buffer.
    <p>
        If you need to grab a substring that falls between the beginning and 
        end of a longer string, you combine these two techniques: use pointer 
        arithmetic to get a pointer to the start of the substring, then use 
        <code>str<mark>n</mark>cpy()</code> to copy just the characters you 
        need.
    <h2>Warning: beware encoding issues!</h2>
    <p>
        Slicing and dicing C strings is easy when you're using a single byte 
        encoding like ASCII.  If you're using a multibyte encoding like UTF-8, 
        you need to be aware that one logical character may require two or more 
        bytes.  If you want to omit the first three logical characters in a 
        string, you need to examine each byte from the start of a string to 
        determine if it's part of a multibyte sequence, and adjust your string 
        pointer accordingly.  If you need to work with multibyte encodings, I 
        recommend finding an appropriate library for the encoding, such as the 
        <a href=https://icu.unicode.org>International Components for Unicode</a>
         for working with Unicode encodings.  Or better yet, transform your C 
        strings into <code>NSString</code>s.
    <h2>Substrings of <code>NSString</code>s</h2>
    <p>
        There are three ways to get a substring of an <code>NSString</code>.  
        First we'll look at taking a substring from the start of an 
        <code>NSString</code>:
    <pre>// create a substring from the start of source
NSString *source = @"foobar";

NSString *substring = [source substringToIndex:3];
// substring is "foo"</pre>
    <p>
        The substring returned by <code>-substringToIndex:</code> is 
        autoreleased.  You should <code>-retain</code> or <code>-copy</code> it 
        if you need to hold on to it.
    <p>
        Similarly, to get a substring that starts in the middle of an 
        <code>NSString</code> and goes to the end:
    <pre>// create a substring to the end of source
NSString *source = @"foobar";

NSString *substring = [source substringFromIndex:3];
// substring is "bar"</pre>
    <p>
        Finally, the general purpose way to create a substring of an 
        <code>NSString</code> is the <code>-substringWithRange:</code> method, 
        which uses an <code>NSRange</code> structure, which is defined 
        something like this:
    <pre>// NSRange structure
struct NSRange {
  NSUInteger location;
  NSUInteger length;
}</pre>
    <p>
        When used with <code>-substringWithRange:</code> method, the 
        <code>NSRange</code>'s <code>location</code> field is the zero-based 
        index of the first character to be included in the substring, and the 
        <code>length</code> field is the number of characters to include in the 
        substring.  Here are some examples:
    <pre>// -substringWithRange: examples
NSString *source = @"foobar";
NSRange range;

range.location = 0;
range.length = 3;
NSString *frontHalf = [source substringWithRange:range];
// frontHalf is "foo"

range.location = 3;
range.length = 3;
NSString *backHalf = [source substringWithRange:range];
// backHalf is "bar"

range.location = 2;
range.length = 2;
NSString *middle = [source substringWithRange:range];
// middle = "ob"</pre>
    <p>
        One word of caution: if the range you give falls outside the receiver 
        (the source string), this method will raise an 
        <code>NSRangeException</code>.
    <p>
        Setting the fields of <code>NSRange</code> is fairly verbose; it's 
        generally more convenient to use the <code>NSMakeRange()</code> 
        function to create the <code>NSRange</code> structure instead.
    <pre>// NSMakeRange() example
NSString *source = @"foobar";

NSString *frontHalf = [source substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(0, 3)];
// frontHalf is "foo"</pre>
    <h2>NSString encoding mostly not a worry</h2>
    <p>
        Internally, <code>NSString</code> uses UTF-16 encoding.  Although 
        UTF-16 is a variable length encoding like UTF-8, characters from the 
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane>basic 
        multilingual plane</a> are all two bytes (one word) in length.  If 
        you're certain that your <code>NSString</code> contains only basic 
        multilingual plane characters, then methods like <code>-length</code> 
        and <code>-substringWithRange:</code> will work exactly as you expect 
        them.  However, if your <code>NSString</code> includes characters 
        outside the basic multilingual plane, it will contain 
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#Code_points_from_U+010000_to_U+10FFFF>surrogate 
        pairs</a>, which are multi-word sequences that represent a single 
        character.  You'll find that <code>-length</code> tells you the number 
        of <em>words</em> rather than logical <em>characters</em>, and if 
        you're not careful, methods like <code>-substringWithRange:</code> can 
        split a surrogate pair in half, leaving you with an invalidly encoded 
        string.
    <p>
        Unless your application needs to work with characters outside the basic 
        multilingual plane, the easiest solution is to filter out such 
        characters when you accept data from a source outside your app.  Since 
        the basic multilingual plane contains all the characters in common use 
        in most modern languages, this is sufficient for many applications.  
        The standard iOS input keyboards limit the user to characters in the 
        basic multilingual plane, but if your app reads data from the network, 
        such as an RSS feed you don't control, you need to watch out for this.
