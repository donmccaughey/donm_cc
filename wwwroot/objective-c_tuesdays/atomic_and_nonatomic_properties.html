    <h1>Atomic And Nonatomic Properties</h1>
    <p>
        Two weeks ago we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/at-property_and_at-synthesize.html>the 
        <code>@property</code> directive</a> and last week we saw how to use 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/synthesizing_properties.html>the 
        <code>@synthesize</code> directive</a> to tell the compiler to generate 
        getters and setters for properties.  We've covered the most commonly 
        used attributes of the <code>@property</code> directive: 
        <code>readonly</code>/<code>readwrite</code> and 
        <code>assign</code>/<code>retain</code>/<code>copy</code>.  Today we'll 
        look at the <code>nonatomic</code> attribute and talk about what it's 
        for and why you should (or should not) use it.
    <h2>Threads and data</h2>
    <p>
        By default, your app's code executes on the main thread of your app's 
        process, along with most Cocoa Touch framework code.  Any particular 
        method or function runs uninterrupted from start to finish and as long 
        as that method or function leaves all the data it touches in a good 
        state when it returns, your program runs correctly.
    <p>
        When you have multiple threads in your application, things aren't so 
        easy.  One key challenge when using multiple threads is to make sure 
        you only read data when it's in a consistent state.  This is similar in 
        concept to using a transaction in a SQL database.
    <p>
        Suppose you have a custom UI object that's defined like this:
    <pre>@interface MyWidget {
  CGPoint center;
  // ...
}
@property CGPoint center;
// ...
@end

@implementation

@synthesize center;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        If you treat instances of this class as read only when you share them 
        between threads, you're safe.  The trouble appears when one or both 
        threads start to make changes to the object.  If we were to write the 
        getter and setter for <code>center</code>, it would look like this:
    <pre>// example assign-type getter and setter
- (CGPoint) center {
  return center;
}
- (void)setCenter:(CGPoint)theCenter {
  center = theCenter;
}</pre>
    <p>
        This looks simple enough, but the compiler is helping us out here.  The 
        <code>center</code> instance variable is a <code>struct</code> that's 
        defined like this:
    <pre>// struct CGPoint
struct CGPoint {
  CGFloat x;
  CGFloat y;
};</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>setCenter:</code> method is actually doing something like 
        this:
    <pre>- (void)setCenter:(CGPoint)theCenter {
  center.x = theCenter.x;
  center.y = theCenter.y;
}</pre>
    <p>
        Let's look at what happens when one thread calls the setter and a 
        second thread calls the getter.  In the simple case, the setter and 
        getter calls don't overlap:
    <pre>// given MyWidget instance myWidget:

// thread 1 calls setter:
[myWidget setCenter:CGPointMake(<mark>1.0f, 2.0f</mark>)];

// setCenter method executes:
- (void)setCenter:(CGPoint)theCenter {
  center.x = theCenter.x; // 1.0f
  center.y = theCenter.y; // 2.0f
}
// center is now {<mark>1.0f, 2.0f</mark>}

// ... thread 1 preempted by thread 2 ...

                    // thread 2 calls getter:
                    CGPoint point = [myWidget center];
                    
                    // center method executes:
                    - (CGPoint) center {
                      return center; // 1.0f, 2.0f
                    }
                    
                    // point is now {<mark>1.0f, 2.0f</mark>}</pre>
    <p>
        In this case, we get the answer we expect.  Now suppose we do this 
        again, only thread 1 gets preempted by thread 2 in the middle of the 
        <code>setCenter</code> method:
    <pre>// myWidget.center is {1.0f, 2.0f}

// thread 1 calls setter:
[myWidget setCenter:CGPointMake(3.0f, 5.0f)];

// setCenter method executes:
- (void)setCenter:(CGPoint)theCenter {
  center.x = theCenter.x; // 3.0f

// ... thread 1 preempted by thread 2 ...

                    // thread 2 calls getter:
                    CGPoint point = [myWidget center];
                    
                    // center method executes:
                    - (CGPoint) center {
                      return center; // 3.0f, <mark>2.0f</mark>
                    }
                    
                    // point is now {3.0f, <mark>2.0f</mark>}

  center.y = theCenter.y; // 5.0f
}

// myWidget.center is now {3.0f, <mark>5.0f</mark>}
// but thread 2 read {3.0f, <mark>2.0f</mark>}</pre>
    <p>
        Now thread 2 is working off of a corrupt value and things are likely to 
        go haywire.  To solve this problem, we need to prevent all threads from 
        reading <code>center</code> until the <code>setCenter:</code> method is 
        finished.  Because this is a common problem in multithreaded code, 
        Objective-C has a special directive to accomplish this: 
        <code>@synchronized</code>.  We can rewrite our getter and setter for 
        the <code>center</code> property like this:
    <pre>// adding @synchronized to getter and setter
- (CGPoint) center {
  CGPoint theCenter;
  <mark>@synchronized(self)</mark> {
    theCenter = center;
  }
  return theCenter;
}
- (void)setCenter:(CGPoint)theCenter {
  <mark>@synchronized(self)</mark> {
    center = theCenter;
  }
}</pre>
    <p>
        Now when we read and write <code>center</code> from two threads, 
        <code>@synchronized</code> causes other threads to pause whenever one 
        thread is inside either of the <code>@synchronized</code> blocks:
    <pre>// myWidget.center is {1.0f, 2.0f}

// thread 1 calls setter:
[myWidget setCenter:CGPointMake(3.0f, 5.0f)];

// setCenter method executes:
- (void)setCenter:(CGPoint)theCenter {
  <mark>@synchronized(self)</mark> {
    center.x = theCenter.x; // 3.0f

// ... thread 1 preempted by thread 2 ...

                    // thread 2 calls getter:
                    CGPoint point = [myWidget center];
                    
                    // center method executes:
                    - (CGPoint) center {
                      CGPoint theCenter;
                      <mark>@synchronized(self)</mark> {
                      // thread 1 is already synchronized on 
                      // <mark>self</mark> so thread 2 pauses here

// ... thread 2 yields and thread 1 runs again ...

    // still inside @synchronized on thread 1
    center.y = theCenter.y; // 5.0f
  }
}

// ... thread 1 preempted by thread 2 again ...

                      <mark>@synchronized(self)</mark> {
                        // now thread 2 resumes
                        theCenter = center; // 3.0f, 5.0f
                      }
                      return theCenter; // 3.0f, <mark>5.0f</mark>
                    }
                    
                    // point is now {3.0f, <mark>5.0f</mark>}</pre>
    <p>
        I'm glossing over many of the details of <code>@synchronized</code>  
        here.  If you're writing multithreaded code, you should read the 
        <a href=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/Introduction/Introduction.html>Threading 
        Programming Guide</a>.  The key concept here is that by default, the 
        <code>@synthesize</code> directive generates this type of 
        synchronization for you.
    <h2>Atomic or <code>nonatomic</code></h2>
    <p>
        Behind the scenes, the <code>@synchronized</code> directive uses a lock 
        to prevent two threads from accessing a <code>@synchronized</code> 
        block simultaneously.  Although acquiring and releasing the lock is 
        very quick, it's not free.  Occasionally you have a property that is so 
        frequently accessed that all this locking and unlocking adds up to a 
        noticeable penalty.  In these rare cases, you can declare the property 
        to be <code>nonatomic</code>:
    <pre>@interface MyWidget {
  CGPoint center;
  // ...
}
@property (<mark>nonatomic</mark>) CGPoint center;
// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        The compiler omits the synchronization code when generating 
        <code>nonatomic</code> getters and setters.  Note that there isn't a 
        corresponding <code>atomic</code> attribute for <code>@property</code>; 
        generated getters and setters are synchronized by default.
    <h2>Don't prematurely optimize</h2>
    <p>
        Acquiring a lock is very fast in the common case where no other thread 
        is holding it.  According to Apple's docs, it takes about 0.0000002 
        seconds (that's 0.2 microseconds) on a modern Mac.  Even though the 
        iPhone is much slower, you need to be acquiring locks hundreds of 
        thousands of times before you should consider synchronization overhead 
        as anything significant.  For the vast majority of code, you should 
        simply not even worry about <code>nonatomic</code>.
    <p>
        Also, keep in mind that the attributes you set on your 
        <code>@property</code> declarations only apply when you use 
        <code>@synthesize</code> to have the compiler generate the getter and 
        setter methods.  If you write the getter or setter yourself, the 
        attributes are ignored.  
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/changing_default_property_names.html>Next 
        week</a> we'll look a little more at synchronization and show you how 
        to write a thread safe getter when returning an Objective-C object.
