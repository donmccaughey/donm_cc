    <h1>Concatenating Strings</h1>
    <p>
        Last week we reviewed 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/wide_character_strings.html>wide 
        character strings</a>.  Today we'll begin looking at common string 
        operations using C strings and <code>NSString</code>s, starting with 
        string concatenation.
    <p>
        Many languages have built in support for string concatenation, but C 
        and Objective-C isn't among them.  Instead, joining strings is 
        accomplished using library functions in C and member functions of the 
        <code>NSString</code> class in Objective-C.
    <h2>C strings</h2>
    <p>
        Concatenating two C strings is particularly error prone, since it 
        typically requires manually calculating the required buffer size and 
        allocating it.
    <pre>// concatenating two C strings
char const *s1 = "foo";
char const *s2 = "bar";
size_t size = (strlen(s1) * sizeof(char)) + (strlen(s2) * sizeof(char)) + sizeof('\0');
char *s3 = malloc(size);
if (s3) {
  strcpy(s3, s1);
  strcat(s3, s2);
} else {
  // handle memory allocation failure
}</pre>
    <p>
        Exploring this code in logical chunks, the first two lines are specific 
        to this example: they define the two strings we're going to join, 
        <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>.  The next line calculates the 
        number of bytes required to hold the new string.
    <pre>// calculate size of new string
size_t size = (strlen(s1) * sizeof(char)) + (strlen(s2) * sizeof(char)) + sizeof('\0');</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>strlen()</code> function counts the number of 
        <code>char</code>s in a string, <em>not</em> including the null 
        terminator.  To be pedantically correct, we multiply the length of each 
        string by the size of a <code>char</code>, but since the 
        <code>char</code> integer type is one byte in size, we can write the 
        size calculation this way instead:
    <pre>size_t size = strlen(s1) + strlen(s2) + sizeof('\0');</pre>
    <p>
        If we were concatenating two wide character strings instead, we 
        wouldn't be able to take that shortcut:
    <pre>size_t size = (wcslen(ws1) * sizeof(wchar_t)) + (wcslen(ws2) * sizeof(wchar_t)) + sizeof(L'\0');</pre>
    <p>
        As a matter of style, I like to use the expression 
        <code>sizeof('\0')</code> to account for the size of the null 
        terminator, but it's more common to simply add one:
    <pre>size_t size = strlen(s1) + strlen(s2) + 1;</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>malloc()</code> function allocates a block of memory.  If 
        <code>malloc()</code> succeeds, it returns a non-<code>NULL</code> 
        pointer to the memory you requested.
    <pre>char *s3 = malloc(size);</pre>
    <p>
        After checking that the value of pointer <code>s3</code> is not 
        <code>NULL</code>, we first call <code>strcpy()</code> 
        ("<mark>str</mark>ing <mark>c</mark>o<mark>py</mark>") to copy the 
        string pointed to by <code>s1</code> into the memory pointed to 
        <code>s3</code>.
    <pre>if (s3) {
  strcpy(s3, s1);</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>strcpy()</code> function always places a null terminator at 
        the end of the destination string.  When <code>strcpy()</code> returns, 
        <code>s1</code> and <code>s3</code> point to identical C strings at 
        different locations in memory.
    <p>
        Finally, we call <code>strcat()</code> ("<mark>str</mark>ing 
        <mark>cat</mark>enate") to append <code>s2</code> to the end of 
        <code>s3</code>.  ("Catenate" is a synonym for "concatenate".  Isn't 
        English strange?)
    <pre>strcat(s3, s2);</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>strcat()</code> function first walks down the destination 
        string until it finds the null terminator, then it copies the source 
        string there, overwriting the original null terminator and putting a 
        new null terminator at the end of the appended string.  When using 
        <code>strcat()</code> you need to be sure that the destination memory 
        block contains enough space to hold the concatenated strings.  If it's 
        too small, you will overwrite memory some other memory block, causing 
        data corruption or a program crash.
    <p>
        If there isn't enough memory available, <code>malloc()</code> returns 
        <code>NULL</code>.
    <pre>if (s3) {
  // ...
} else {
  // handle memory allocation failure
}</pre>
    <p>
        Checking this return value is important; trying to use a 
        <code>NULL</code> pointer will cause your program to be killed by the 
        system.  Unfortunately handling errors like this deep in your code is 
        generally a pain in the butt; frequently there's no good option except 
        to abort the current operation.
    <h2>using a fixed buffer</h2>
    <p>
        If you know the maximum size of the strings before hand and the 
        concatenated string is an intermediate value, you can often use a fixed 
        buffer instead of a call to <code>malloc()</code>:
    <pre>// concatenating two C strings
// using a fixed buffer
char const *s1 = "foo";
char const *s2 = "bar";
char buffer[80];

strcpy(buffer, s1);
strcat(buffer, s2);
// buffer now holds concatenated strings</pre>
    <p>
        This greatly simplifies C string concatenation, but if your input 
        strings are too big, you'll overflow your buffer and cause a program 
        crash.
    <h2><code>NSString</code>s</h2>
    <p>
        Appending one <code>NSString</code> to another is pretty straight 
        forward.  The <code>-stringByAppendingString:</code> instance method 
        performs string concatenation, returning a new <code>NSString</code> 
        instance
    <pre>// concatenating two NSStrings
NSString *s1 = @"foo";
NSString *s2 = @"bar";
NSString *s3 = [s1 stringByAppendingString:s2];</pre>
    <p>
        The resulting <code>NSString</code> (<code>s3</code>) is autoreleased 
        and contains "foobar".
    <h2>appending a formatted string</h2>
    <p>
        There's an alternate way to do <code>NSString</code> concatenation by 
        using <code>-stringByAppendingFormat:</code>
    <pre>// concatenating two NSStrings using a format
NSString *s1 = @"foo";
NSString *s2 = @"bar";
NSString *s3 = [s1 stringByAppendingFormat:@"%@", s2];</pre>
    <p>
        Here, we specify a format string that contains an object replacement 
        (<code>%@</code>) only.  Additional arguments after the format string 
        must match the replacement specifiers in the format string.  This 
        method first generates the formatted string then appends it to the 
        receiver (<code>s1</code>).  It's not as efficient as using 
        <code>-stringByAppendingString:</code> directly, but it's more 
        flexible.  You can just as easily append an integer or a C string:
    <pre>NSString *s1 = @"foo";

// appending a number
NSString *s2 = [s1 stringByAppendingFormat:@"%i", 1234];
// s2 is "foo1234"

// appending a C string
char const *s3 = "bar";
NSString *s4 = [s1 stringByAppendingFormat:@"%s", s3];
// s4 is "foobar"</pre>
    <h2><code>NSString</code> preferred</h2>
    <p>
        It should be apparent that <code>NSString</code> concatenation is much 
        easier to deal with than the multi-step procedure required for C 
        strings.  In iOS programs, you should generally use 
        <code>NSString</code> whenever possible.
