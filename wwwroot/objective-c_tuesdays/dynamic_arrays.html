    <h1>Dynamic Arrays</h1>
    <p>
        Another week, another Objective-C Tuesdays. Last week we began our 
        series on data structures with a look at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/arrays.html>arrays in C and the 
        <code>NSArray</code> class</a>. Both C arrays and <code>NSArray</code> 
        objects have serious limitations: C arrays are fixed in size and 
        <code>NSArray</code>s are immutable. Today we will look at overcoming 
        those limitations.
    <h2>Dynamically allocated memory</h2>
    <p>
        C arrays are fixed in size when they are declared:
    <pre>int lotteryNumbers[6];</pre>
    <p>
        Here we declare an array that can hold six <code>int</code>s. We can 
        freely change the six <code>int</code> values we store in the array, 
        but we can't make the array larger or smaller once it's declared. But 
        there's nothing really magical about arrays in C: in essence they're 
        blocks of memory managed by the compiler. When we declare an array, we 
        tell the compiler the number of items we need to store and the type of 
        item and it calculates the number of bytes of memory it needs to set 
        aside for the array. We can do the same thing with a dynamically 
        allocated memory block. Let's dynamically allocate the same amount of 
        storage using <code>malloc()</code>:
    <pre>// dynamically allocating an array
#include &lt;stdlib.h>

int *lotteryNumbers = <mark>malloc</mark>(sizeof(int) * 6);
if (lotteryNumbers) {
  lotteryNumbers[0] = 7;
  lotteryNumbers[1] = 11;
  // ...
}</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>malloc()</code> function is part of the standard C library, 
        and it allocates a memory block on the <em>heap</em>. As we saw last 
        time, you can use the same square bracket index notation with an array 
        variable or a pointer to a block of memory.
    <p>
        Unlike global variables (which persist for the whole life span of your 
        program) and local variables (which live only as long as the current 
        function call), you control the life span of memory you allocate on the 
        heap. Just as you need to match <code>-retain</code> with 
        <code>-release</code> in Objective-C, you need to match calls to 
        <code>malloc()</code> with corresponding calls to <code>free()</code>:
    <pre>// always free dynamically allocating arrays
#include &lt;stdlib.h>
// ...

int *lotteryNumbers = malloc(sizeof(int) * 6);

// use lotteryNumbers for a while...

<mark>free</mark>(lotteryNumbers);</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>malloc()</code> function takes one argument: the number of 
        <em>bytes</em> to allocate. Since most useful items require more than 
        one byte each, you need to use the <code>sizeof()</code> operator to 
        get the size of the item type and multiply it by the number of items 
        required.
    <pre>// calculate the number of bytes required
// using the <mark>sizeof()</mark> operator
int *lotteryNumbers = malloc(<mark>sizeof(int) * 6</mark>);
if (lotteryNumbers) {
  // ...</pre>
    <p>
        The <code>malloc()</code> function returns a pointer to the newly 
        allocated memory block on success. If <code>malloc()</code> fails, it 
        returns <code>NULL</code>. You should always check the result of memory 
        allocation and take appropriate action. The typical C idiom is to use 
        the returned pointer as a boolean value, since <code>NULL</code> 
        pointers in C evaluate to <em>false</em> while non-<code>NULL</code> 
        pointers are <em>true</em>, similar to <code>nil</code> values in 
        Objective-C.
    <pre>// always test the returned pointer
int *lotteryNumbers = malloc(<mark>sizeof(int) * 6</mark>);
if (lotteryNumbers) {
  // okay to use...
} else {
  // we're out of memory...
}</pre>
    <h2>Handling <code>malloc()</code> failures</h2>
    <p>
        If a call to <code>malloc()</code> fails and returns <code>NULL</code>, 
        it's almost always because you've run out of available memory. There 
        are two broad strategies for coping with a memory allocation failure: 
        fail fast or abort the operation. In general, I recommend that you fail 
        fast by doing something like this:
    <pre>// fail fast when out of memory

int *lotteryNumbers = malloc(sizeof(int) * 6);
if ( ! lotteryNumbers) {
  fprintf(stderr, "%s:%i: Out of memory\n", __FILE__, __LINE__);
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
// okay to use memory
lotteryNumbers[0] = 7;
// ...</pre>
    <p>
        In an Objective-C program, you would use <code>NSLog()</code> instead 
        of <code>fprintf()</code>. When small to medium size memory allocations 
        fail, the system is seriously constrained and there's not much else 
        your program can do to cope. In fact, iOS will likely terminate your 
        app before you ever reach this condition.
    <p>
        Sometimes your program is trying to do something particularly memory 
        intensive, like editing a large image or sound file. In cases like 
        this, you should be prepared for large memory allocations to fail and 
        try to abort the operation gracefully. The strategy in this case is to 
        free all resources allocated for the operation so far and alert the 
        user. 
    <h2>Using <code>calloc()</code> instead of <code>malloc()</code></h2>
    <p>
        When you dynamically allocate a memory block, you frequently want to 
        set all the items to zero. <code>malloc()</code> doesn't do any 
        initialization to the memory block, so the initial contents are 
        effectively random garbage. The <code>calloc()</code> function is 
        similar to <code>malloc()</code>, but also <em>clears</em> the bytes in 
        the memory block to zeros before returning.
    <pre>// using calloc()
size_t itemCount = 6;
size_t itemSize = sizeof(int);
int *lotteryNumbers = <mark>calloc(itemCount, itemSize)</mark>;
if (lotteryNumbers) {
  // okay to use...</pre>
    <p>
        Unlike <code>malloc()</code> which takes the size of the memory block 
        in bytes, <code>calloc()</code> takes the number of items and the size 
        of each item and does the math for you. Under the covers, 
        <code>calloc()</code> allocates memory from the same heap that 
        <code>malloc()</code> uses, so you need to call <code>free()</code> on 
        the memory block when you're done.
    <p>
        There's a lot more to managing dynamically allocated memory blocks. 
        We'll look at resizing a memory block using <code>realloc()</code> next 
        time but for now let's move on to a more pleasant topic: 
        <code>NSMutableArray</code>.
    <h2><code>NSMutableArray</code></h2>
    <p>
        Like its immutable super class <code>NSArray</code>, the 
        <code>NSMutableArray</code> class takes mutable array management to a 
        higher level. You can create an <code>NSMutableArray</code> the same 
        way you create an <code>NSArray</code>:
    <pre>NSMutableArray *colors = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"red", 
                                                          @"green", 
                                                          @"blue", 
                                                          nil];</pre>
    <p>
        Another common creation technique is to duplicate an existing immutable 
        <code>NSArray</code> using the <code>+arrayWithArray:</code> or 
        <code>-initWithArray:</code> methods.
    <pre>NSArray *rgbColors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"red", 
                                               @"green", 
                                               @"blue", 
                                               nil];
NSMutableArray *colors = [NSMutableArray <mark>arrayWithArray:</mark>rgbColors];</pre>
    <p>
        Often, you simply want an empty array to start with. The 
        <code>+array</code> or <code>-init</code> methods from 
        <code>NSArray</code> will do the trick here. (You can create empty 
        immutable <code>NSArray</code> objects this way too, they're just 
        usually not very useful.) 
    <p>
        Adding items to the end of the array is easily done with 
        <code>-addObject:</code> and <code>-addObjectsFromArray:</code>
    <pre>NSMutableArray *colors = [NSMutableArray array];
// colors is empty

[colors <mark>addObject:</mark>@"yellow"];
[colors <mark>addObject:</mark>@"purple"];
// colors holds yellow, purple

NSArray *designerColors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"mauve", 
                                                    @"chartreuse", 
                                                    @"seafoam", 
                                                    nil];
[colors <mark>addObjectsFromArray:</mark>designerColors];
// colors now holds yellow, purple, mauve, chartreuse and seafoam</pre>
    <p>
        <code>NSMutableArray</code> has many ways to remove objects. The 
        <code>-removeLastObject</code> method is the inverse of 
        <code>-addObject:</code>. The <code>-removeObjectAtIndex:</code> method 
        removes an item at a particular index. Continuing with our array of 
        colors:
    <pre>// colors holds yellow, purple, mauve, chartreuse and seafoam
[colors removeLastObject];
// colors holds yellow, purple, mauve and chartreuse
[colors removeObjectAtIndex:0];
// colors holds purple, mauve and chartreuse</pre>
    <p>
        That covers the basics of adding and removing objects from an 
        <code>NSMutableArray</code>. Next time, we'll cover more ways to 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/more_about_dynamic_arrays.html>manipulate 
        the mutable array contents</a>.
