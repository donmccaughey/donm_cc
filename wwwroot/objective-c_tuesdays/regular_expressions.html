    <h1>Regular Expressions</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome back to Objective-C Tuesdays after a long hiatus. In the last 
        couple of entries, we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/searching_in_strings.html>searching</a> 
        and <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/replacing_in_strings.html>replacing 
        in C strings and 
        </a><code><a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/replacing_in_strings.html>NSString</a></code><a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/replacing_in_strings.html>s</a>. 
        Today we'll look at a more powerful way to search and replace in 
        strings: regular expressions.
    <h2>A mini language</h2>
    <p>
        Regular expressions is a small, specialized programming language for 
        matching text. In addition to being specialized in scope, regular 
        expressions are also very compact, which can make them very hard to 
        read. I won't cover regular expression grammar in dept here—there are 
        plenty of regular expression tutorials, references and cheat sheets out 
        there. If you're looking for a good reference, I recommend O'Reilly's 
        <a href=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-regular-expressions/0596528124/ ><em>Mastering 
        Regular Expressions</em></a> and the 
        <a href=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/regular-expressions-cookbook/9780596802837/ ><em>Regular 
        Expressions Cookbook</em></a>.
    <p>
        Some programming languages have first class support for regular 
        expressions, including Perl, Ruby and JavaScript. Modern languages like 
        Python and Java support regular expressions as part of the language's 
        standard library. Unfortunately C doesn't have regular expression 
        support as part of its standard library. For Objective-C, regular 
        expression support first appeared with iOS 3.2 on iPad and 4.0 on 
        iPhone. Before that, developers needed to use a third party library to 
        use regular expressions in their apps.
    <h2>Some simple examples</h2>
    <p>
        Most characters in regular expressions match themselves, but some 
        characters have special meaning. Here's a simple regular expression 
        that matches the word "foobar":
    <pre>foobar</pre>
    <p>
        To match "foo" followed by one 'b' character, you could use:
    <pre>foob?</pre>
    <p>
        Here, the '?' character is a special character that modifies the 
        expression before it, (in this case the character 'b') and matches it 
        zero or one times. Thus <code>foob?</code> will match "foo" or "foob" 
        but not "foe".
    <p>
        To match "foo" followed by zero or more 'b' characters, you could use:
    <pre>foob*</pre>
    <p>
        The '*' special character matches the preceding expression zero or more 
        times. <code>foob*</code> will match "foo", "foob" and "foobbbbbb" but 
        not "fod".
    <p>
        To match "foo" followed by one or more 'b' characters, you could use:
    <pre>foob+</pre>
    <p>
        The '+' special character matches the preceding expression one or more 
        times. <code>foob+</code> will match "foob" and "foobbbbbb" but not 
        "foo" or "food".
    <p>
        Regular expression languages have many more capabilities. Though 
        different regular expression implementations have different 
        capabilities, most share a large set of common operations,.
    <h2>C libraries for regular expressions</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href=https://www.pcre.org><strong>PCRE</strong> or Perl 
        Compatible Regular Expressions</a> library is a widely used C library 
        that implements the same regular expression language that's used in 
        Perl 5. The PCRE library is open source and distributed under a BSD 
        license. It's a substantial library, and due to the lack of support on 
        iOS for OS X style frameworks, it can be a bit challenging to include 
        in an iOS project. In addition, because it's a C library, working with 
        PCRE requires more low-level code than many Cocoa Touch programmers are 
        comfortable with.
    <p>
        Here's a PCRE code snippet that compiles the regular expression 
        <code>foo(bar|fy)</code> and tests it against the string 
        <code>"foofy"</code>.
    <pre>#include &lt;pcre.h>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>
#include &lt;string.h>

#define OUTPUT_VECTOR_COUNT 30    /* should be a multiple of 3 */

/* ... */

char const *pattern = "foo(bar|fy)";
int compileOptions = 0;
char const *error;
int errorOffset;
unsigned char const *characterTable = NULL;
pcre *regularExpression = pcre_compile(pattern, compileOptions, 
                                       &amp;error, &amp;errorOffset, characterTable);

if ( ! regularExpression) {
  NSLog(@"ERROR: regular expression &lt;%s> failed to compile\n", pattern);
  NSLog(@"  Error at offset %i: %s\n", errorOffset, error);
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

pcre_extra *extraData = NULL;
char const *subject = "foofy";
int subjectLength = strlen(subject);
int subjectOffset = 0;
int execOptions = 0;
int outputVector[OUTPUT_VECTOR_COUNT];
int execResultCount = pcre_exec(regularExpression, extraData, 
                                subject, subjectLength, subjectOffset, 
                                execOptions, outputVector, OUTPUT_VECTOR_COUNT);

if (execResultCount == PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH) {
  NSLog(@"The subject &lt;%s> did not match the pattern &lt;%s>\n", subject, pattern);
} else if (execResultCount &lt; 0) {
  NSLog(@"Unexpected pcre_exec() result %i\n", execResultCount);
} else if (execResultCount == 0) {
  NSLog(@"Output vector only has room for %i captured substrings\n", 
        execResultCount - 1);
} else {
  int resultIndex;
  
  NSLog(@"Found match for pattern &lt;%s> in subject &lt;%s> at offset %i\n", 
        pattern, subject, outputVector[0]);
  for (resultIndex = 0; resultIndex &lt; execResultCount; ++resultIndex) {
    int substringIndex = 2 * resultIndex;
    int substringStartingOffset = outputVector[substringIndex];
    int substringEndingOffset = outputVector[substringIndex + 1];
    char const* substringStart = subject + substringStartingOffset;
    int substringLength = substringEndingOffset - substringStartingOffset;
    NSLog(@"match %i: &lt;%.*s>\n", resultIndex, substringLength, substringStart);
  }
}

pcre_free(regularExpression);

        As you can see, it takes a lot of boilerplate code to do even a simple 
        regular expression search using PCRE, but it's a very powerful library 
        used by many well knows open source and commercial projects, including 
        Apple's Safari browser. The PCRE project also includes a set of C++ 
        wrappers that make the library easier to use from that language. If you 
        only plan to target OS X, there is also the very excellent 
        <a href=http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/ >RegexKit</a> open source 
        library that provides a nice Objective-C wrapper around PCRE. The PCRE 
        library can be built with Unicode support, but is limited to scanning 
        UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings, since it's a byte oriented library.
    <p>
        The 
        <a href=https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html><strong>POSIX 
        Regular Expressions</strong></a> specification describes a regular 
        expression dialect and 
        <a href=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/regex.3.html>C 
        interface</a> that is supported on many variants of Unix and Linux, 
        including OS X and iOS. Like many specifications, POSIX regular 
        expressions are a "lowest common denominator" solution and lack some of 
        the advanced features found in regular expression variants like Perl 
        and PCRE. The POSIX regular expression interface is much smaller than 
        what PCRE provides: four functions, two structs and a bunch of 
        constants. Here's a PCRE code snippet that compiles the regular 
        expression <code>foo(bar|fy)</code> and tests it against the string 
        <code>"foofy"</code> using the POSIX interface.
    <pre>#import &lt;regex.h>

#define MATCH_COUNT 10

/* ... */

regex_t regularExpression;
char const *pattern = "foo(fy|bar)";
int compileFlags = REG_EXTENDED;

int compileResult = regcomp(&amp;regularExpression, pattern, compileFlags);

if (compileResult) {
  size_t bufferSize = regerror(compileResult, &amp;regularExpression, NULL, 0);
  char *buffer = malloc(bufferSize);
  if ( ! buffer) {
    NSLog(@"Memory allocation failed");
    return;
  }
  regerror(compileResult, &amp;regularExpression, buffer, bufferSize);
  NSLog(@"%s", buffer);
  free(buffer);
  return;
}

char const *string = "foofy";
regmatch_t matches[MATCH_COUNT];
int executeFlags = 0;

int executeResult = regexec(&amp;regularExpression, string, 
                            MATCH_COUNT, matches, executeFlags);

if (executeResult == REG_NOMATCH) {
  NSLog(@"Pattern &lt;%s> doesn't match string &lt;%s>\n", pattern, string);
} else {  
  NSLog(@"Pattern &lt;%s> matches string &lt;%s>\n", pattern, string);
  NSLog(@"Found %lu submatches\n", (unsigned long)regularExpression.re_nsub);
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; regularExpression.re_nsub + 1; ++i) {
    int substringLength = matches[i].rm_eo - matches[i].rm_so;
    char const *substringStart = string + matches[i].rm_so;
    NSLog(@"submatch %lu: &lt;%.*s>\n", (unsigned long)i, substringLength, substringStart);
  }
}

regfree(&amp;regularExpression);

    <p>
        This is a little more concise than the PCRE version, mainly because the 
        POSIX functions have fewer options, but is still very low level. POSIX 
        regular expression implementations are generally regarded as slower 
        than PCRE, and don't provide any explicit Unicode support (though you 
        may be able to do regex matching against UTF-8 encoded strings if 
        you're careful to keep your UTF-8 strings 
        <a href=https://unicode.org/faq/normalization.html>normalized</a>).
    <p>
        The <a href=https://icu.unicode.org><strong>ICU</strong> or 
        International Components for Unicode</a> library is included as part of 
        iOS. (ICU is open source and carries a 
        <a href=https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/main/icu4c/LICENSE>non-restrictive 
        license</a>.) The ICU is a general purpose library for working with 
        Unicode text which includes Unicode-aware regular expression support. 
        It has two versions: one for Java and another for C and C++. The C/C++ 
        version features a low level C function interface and a set of higher 
        level C++ classes. I'll only look at the C interface to ICU here.
    <p>
        Because the ICU library is a general purpose Unicode library, most 
        operations require that C strings be converted into ICU's Unicode text 
        type, <code>UChar *</code>, which makes the ICU example the longest yet:
    <pre>// compile regular expression
char const *pattern = "foo(bar|fy)";

                                                     &amp;parseError, &amp;errorCode);
if (errorCode) {
  NSLog(@"uregex_openC() failed: %li: %s", 
        (long)errorCode, u_errorName(errorCode));

        (long)parseError.line, (long)parseError.offset);
  return;

        I wouldn't be surprised if there's a memory leak in there somewhere. 
        I'm also no expert on this library, and I may be doing some things the 
        hard way. If you're using C++, I'm sure a lot of this boilerplate code 
        goes away. If you don't need or want to mix C++ into your iOS app, 
        there are some Objective-C alternatives that are much more satisfying.
    <h2>Regular expressions in Objective-C</h2>
    <p>
        In iOS 3.2, Apple added a new <code>NSStringCompareOptions</code> value 
        for use in the various <code>-rangeOfString:options:</code> methods of 
        <code>NSString</code>: <em><code>NSRegularExpressionSearch</code></em>. 
        This option uses the regular expression support of the ICU library to 
        do simple regular expression matching on an <code>NSString</code> 
        object. Unfortunately, Apple only implemented a very minimal regular 
        expression interface on <code>NSString</code>. You can search, but not 
        replace, within an <code>NSString</code> and powerful regular 
        expression features like subgroup matching are not exposed.
    <pre>NSString *string = @"foofy";
NSString *pattern = @"foo(bar|fy)";

NSRange match = [string <mark>rangeOfString:</mark>pattern 
                              options:<mark>NSRegularExpressionSearch</mark>];

if (match.location == NSNotFound) {
  NSLog(@"Pattern &lt;%@> doesn't match string &lt;%@>", pattern, string);
} else {
  NSLog(@"Pattern &lt;%@> matches string &lt;%@> starting at location %lu",
        pattern, string, (unsigned long)match.location);
}</pre>
    <p>
        In iOS 4.0, Cocoa Touch gained the 
        <strong><code>NSRegularExpression</code></strong> class, a 
        full-featured regular expression processor built on top of the ICU 
        regular expression library.
    <pre>NSError *error;
NSString *pattern = @"foo(bar|fy)";

NSRegularExpression *regularExpression = [NSRegularExpression regularExpressionWithPattern:pattern 
                                                                                   options:0 
                                                                                     error:&amp;error];

    NSLog(@"submatch %lu: &lt;%@>", (unsigned long)i, submatch);

}</pre>
    <p>
        This is much easier to use than the underlying ICU C library and a good 
        choice for iOS apps that target 4.0 and later.
    <p>
        The 
        <a href=http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/RegexKitLite/ ><strong>RegexKitLite</strong></a>
         library provides an alternate Objective-C wrapper around the low level 
        ICU regular expression library that supports both Mac OS X and iOS, 
        including iOS 3.0. RegexKitLite provides a full featured set of regular 
        expression methods in a category that extends <code>NSString</code> and 
        can do matching, searching, replacing and supports subgroups. 
        RegexKitLite is open source and available under a BSD license.
    <pre>NSString *string = @"foofy";
NSString *pattern = @"foo(bar|fy)";

NSArray *submatches = [string captureComponentsMatchedByRegex:pattern];
if ([submatches count]) {
  NSLog(@"Found %lu submatches", (unsigned long)[submatches count]);
  for (NSUInteger i = 0; i &lt; [submatches count]; ++i) {
    NSLog(@"submatch %lu: &lt;%@>", (unsigned long)i, [submatches objectAtIndex:i]);      
  }
} else {
  NSLog(@"Pattern &lt;%@> doesn't match string &lt;%@>", pattern, string);
}</pre>
    <p>
        RegexKitLite code is a little more concise than the 
        <code>NSRegularExpression</code> class, but comparable in power, since 
        they're both built on top of ICU.
    <h2>Which one to use?</h2>
    <p>
        Unless you're writing cross-platform code in C or need to target very 
        old versions of iOS, I recommend you avoid using the C regular 
        expression libraries. If you must, the POSIX regex functions are the 
        easiest to get started with, but if you're targeting non-Apple 
        platforms, watch out for implementation differences across platforms. 
        Both PCRE and ICU are good cross-platform choices; choose ICU if you 
        also need robust Unicode support, PCRE if you're mainly working with 
        eight bit encodings.

        On the Objective-C side, choosing <code>NSRegularExpression</code> or 
        RegexKitLite is largely up to personal preference. 
        <code>NSRegularExpression</code> is a no-brainer if you're targeting 
        iOS 4.0 and later (but currently not supported on OS X). Adding 
        RegexKitLite to your project is as easy as adding two files to Xcode 
        and currently works on both Apple operating systems. And the 
        <code>-rangeOfString:options:</code> method on <code>NSString</code> is 
        handy for simple searches.
