    <h1>@Property And @Synthesize</h1>
    <p>
        Last time we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/instance_variables_getters_and_setters.html>writing 
        getters and setters for Objective-C classes</a>.  Today we'll look at 
        generating them automatically using the <code>@property</code> and 
        <code>@synthesize</code> directives.
    <p>
        Before Objective-C 2.0 was introduced, if you wanted to add getters and 
        setters to a class, you wrote them yourself using instance methods, 
        which caused some classes to become heavy with boilerplate code:
    <pre>// example of hand-written getters and setters
@interface Person : NSObject {
  int age;
  Address *address;
  NSString *name;
}

- (int)age;
- (void)setAge:(int)anAge;

- (Address *)address;
- (void)setAddress:(Address *)anAddress;

- (NSString *)name;
- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName;

// ...

@end


@implementation Person

- (int)age {
  return age;
}

// assign-type setter
- (void)setAge:(int)anAge {
  age = anAge;
}

- (Address *)address {
  return address;
}

// retain-type setter
- (void)setAddress:(Address *)anAddress {
  if (address != anAddress) {
    [address release];
    address = [anAddress retain];
  }
}

- (NSString *)name {
  return name;
}

// copy-type setter
- (void)setName:(NSString *)aName {
  if (name != aName) {
    [name release];
    name = [aName copy];
  }
}

// ...

@end</pre>
    <p>
        This is a lot of code to write, and the <code>Person</code> class 
        barely does anything yet.  The <code>@property</code> directive will 
        remove some of the boilerplate code from the <code>@interface</code> 
        section of the class and the <code>@synthesize</code> directive will 
        clean up the <code>@implementation</code>
    <h2>Declaring properties</h2>
    <p>
        A getter and setter form a logical <em>property</em> of a class.  
        Properties typically correspond directly to instance variables, but 
        don't have to.  Sometimes a property is calculated on the fly, or the 
        name of the instance variable is different than the name of the 
        property.  The <code>@property</code> directive replaces the getter and 
        setter method declarations in the <code>@interface</code> of the class. 
         
    <pre>// declaring <mark>age</mark> property
@interface Person : NSObject {
  int age;
  Address *address;
  NSString *name;
}

<mark>@property int age</mark>;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        Notice that the property declaration looks a lot like an instance 
        variable declaration.  At a high level, a property is very similar to 
        an instance variable.  But as far as the compiler cares, a 
        <code>@property</code> is simply a replacement for declaring the getter 
        and setter methods:
    <pre>@property int age;</pre>
    <p>
        is just a substitute for
    <pre>- (int)age;
- (void)setAge:(int)anAge;</pre>
    <p>
        If you don't write the corresponding getter and setter methods in the 
        <code>@implementation</code> section, you'll see compiler warnings like 
        this:
    <pre>property 'age' requires method '-age' to be defined - use @synthesize, @dynamic or provide a method implementation
property 'age' requires the method 'setAge:' to be defined - use @synthesize, @dynamic or provide a method implementation</pre>
    <h2>Read-only properties</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes, you want properties to be read-only.  For example, we might 
        store the person's birthdate instead of age:
    <pre>// <mark>age</mark> property calculated on the fly
@interface Person : NSObject {
  NSDate *birthDate;
  Address *address;
  NSString *name;
}

<mark>@property int age</mark>;

// ...
@end

@implementation Person

- (int)age {
  NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
  NSDate *today = [NSDate date];
  NSDateComponents *components = [calendar components:NSYearCalendarUnit 
                                             fromDate:birthDate 
                                               toDate:today 
                                              options:0];
  return components.year;
}

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        Yet it doesn't make sense to write the corresponding 
        <code>setAge:</code> method here.  If we compile this code, we'll still 
        get nagged about the setter:
    <pre>property 'age' requires the method 'setAge:' to be defined - use @synthesize, @dynamic or provide a method implementation</pre>
    <p>
        To silence this, we need to add an <em>attribute</em> to the property.  
        Property attributes go in parentheses after the <code>@property</code> 
        keyword but before the type and name:
    <pre>@property <mark>(readonly)</mark> int age;</pre>
    <p>
        Here we've told the compiler that the <code>age</code> property is 
        <code>readonly</code>, so not to worry about the setter.  By default, 
        properties are <code>readwrite</code>.  You can label them with the 
        <code>readwrite</code> attribute, but since it's the default, it's 
        redundant and you'll rarely see it.
    <h2>Object properties</h2>
    <p>
        Let's set aside the calculated <code>age</code> property and go with 
        our plain old <code>int</code> version.  The next property of the 
        <code>Person</code> class is <code>address</code>:
    <pre>// declaring <mark>address</mark> property
@interface Person : NSObject {
  int age;
  Address *address;
  NSString *name;
}

@property int age;
<mark>@property Address *address</mark>;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        When you compile this, you'll see warnings like:
    <pre>no 'assign', 'retain', or 'copy' attribute is specified - 'assign' is assumed
assign attribute (default) not appropriate for non-gc object property 'address'</pre>
    <p>
        The compiler has noticed that <code>address</code> is an Objective-C 
        object type and is reminding you to do the appropriate memory 
        management.  (Those lucky Mac developers don't have to worry about this 
        any more since they now have garbage collection.)  In addition to 
        <code>readwrite</code>/<code>readonly</code> there's another set of 
        property attributes: <code>assign</code>, <code>retain</code> and 
        <code>copy</code>.  Since <code>address</code> uses retain memory 
        management, we'll change it to look like
    <pre>@property <mark>(retain)</mark> Address *address;</pre>
    <p>
        At this stage, <code>assign</code>, <code>retain</code> and 
        <code>copy</code> are simply documentation to other programmers about 
        the memory management strategy for the property.  If you write the 
        setter yourself, the compiler isn't smart enough to tell if you 
        actually wrote the correct type of setter, so be careful!  There's 
        nothing worse than code that says it's doing one thing and actually 
        does another.  So what's the point?  We'll see when we get to 
        <code>@synthesize</code>.
    <p>
        Finishing up the properties for our class, we declare a property for 
        <code>name</code> that uses a copy memory management scheme.  
        (<a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/instance_variables_getters_and_setters.html>Last 
        week's post</a> explained why we use <code>copy</code> for 
        <code>NSString</code> properties.)
    <pre>// declaring <mark>name</mark> property
@interface Person : NSObject {
  int age;
  Address *address;
  NSString *name;
}

@property int age;
@property (retain) Address *address;
<mark>@property (copy) NSString *name</mark>;

// ...
@end</pre>
    <h2>Plain old pointer properties</h2>
    <p>
        Most Objective-C code uses objects instead of plain old C 
        <code>struct</code>s, strings and arrays, but sometimes you'll need to 
        use them, often when working with low level C libraries.  You might be 
        tempted to document your memory management for these plain old pointers 
        as you would Objective-C objects:
    <pre>// ERROR: won't compile
@interface Person : NSObject {
  int age;
  Address *address;
  NSString *name;
  char const *username; // plain old C string
}

@property int age;
@property (retain) Address *address;
@property (copy) NSString *name;
@property (<mark>copy</mark>) char const *username; // plain old C string

// ...
@end</pre>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, since plain old C types don't have 
        <code>retain</code>/<code>release</code> memory management like 
        Objective-C objects, this muddies the meaning of <code>copy</code> and 
        the compiler will stop with an error like:
    <pre>property 'username' with 'copy' attribute must be of object type</pre>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, marking a property like this <code>assign</code> when 
        your setter actually makes a copy doesn't seem right either:
    <pre>// not quite right
@property (<mark>assign</mark>) char const *username;</pre>
    <p>
        My advice is to leave off <code>assign</code>, <code>retain</code> and 
        <code>copy</code> from properties for plain old C pointers and use a 
        comment to note your memory management strategy.
    <p>
        I'm out of time right now, so I'll have to finish this up next week.  
        Coming up, the 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/atomic_and_nonatomic_properties.html><code>nonatomic</code>
         property attribute</a>, and the 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/synthesizing_properties.html><code>@synthesize</code>
         directive</a>.
