    <h1>More About Dynamic Arrays</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome back to Objective-C Tuesdays. Last time we were talking about 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/dynamic_arrays.html>dynamic arrays in C 
        and <code>NSMutableArray</code> in Objective-C</a>. We'll continue 
        looking at both today.
    <p>
        We looked at using <code>malloc()</code> or <code>calloc()</code> to 
        dynamically allocate a block of memory that you can treat like an 
        array. This is very useful when you don't know the number of items you 
        need to store until run time or when you need the array to exist longer 
        than the current function call.
    <p>
        But what happens when you need to grow or shrink the memory block? 
        Well, the straightforward way would be to allocate a new memory block, 
        copy over the contents and free the old block. You use the 
        <code>memcpy()</code> function in the C standard library to do the 
        copying.
    <pre>// resizing a memory block
int *lotteryNumbers = malloc(sizeof(int) * 6);
if ( ! lotteryNumbers) {
  // memory allocation failed
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
lotteryNumbers[0] = 7;
// ...lotteryNumbers[5] = 29;
// now we need to store more numbers
// so allocate a bigger memory block
int *biggerMemoryBlock = malloc(sizeof(int) * 12);
if ( ! biggerMemoryBlock) {
  // memory allocation failed
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
// copy lotteryNumbers into biggerMemoryBlock
<mark>memcpy(biggerMemoryBlock, lotteryNumbers, sizeof(int) * 6);</mark>
// free old memory block
free(lotteryNumbers);
// replace old memory block pointer with new one
lotteryNumbers = biggerMemoryBlock;
lotteryNumbers[6] = 31;
// ...lotteryNumbers[11] = 49;</pre>
    <p>
        When copying blocks of memory, be careful to specify the correct size 
        in bytes. In the example above, we use the same expression to calculate 
        the size, <code>sizeof(int) * 6</code> for both the original call to 
        <code>malloc()</code> and to <code>memcpy()</code>. Using the 
        <code>sizeof</code> operator like this serves two purposes. It makes 
        the code portable, since the size of an <code>int</code> may be 
        different on some systems (it's four bytes on iOS). More importantly, 
        it tells anyone reading the code that you intended to allocate six 
        <code>int</code>s. If you had specified simply <code>malloc(24)</code> 
        or even <code>malloc(6 * 4)</code>, your intention is not as clear.
    <h2>Resizing a memory block with <code>realloc()</code></h2>
    <p>
        Allocating a larger or smaller memory block and copying over the 
        contents works perfectly, but it is tedious. Fortunately, the C 
        standard library includes the <code>realloc()</code> function which 
        does exactly this for you in one function call. It can operate on any 
        memory block allocated with <code>malloc()</code> or 
        <code>calloc()</code>. In addition, because it's part of the standard 
        library, <code>realloc()</code> can do things that you can't: it will 
        try to grow or shrink the memory block in place, skipping the copy 
        step. Sometimes the memory manager will give you a block of memory 
        somewhat bigger than you requested, other times the memory area after 
        your memory block is currently unused. Because <code>realloc()</code> 
        is privy to the implementation details of the memory manager, it can 
        figure out when it's safe to grow your memory block in place.
    <p>
        The <code>realloc()</code> function returns a pointer to either the 
        original memory block or a new memory block on success, or 
        <code>NULL</code> if memory allocation fails. If the new memory block 
        is bigger than the original, the new items will be set to zero, just as 
        if you allocated the memory block with <code>calloc()</code>. Like 
        <code>malloc()</code>, <code>realloc()</code> requires you to calculate 
        the size of the memory block in bytes.
    <pre>// using realloc()
int *lotteryNumbers = malloc(sizeof(int) * 2);
if ( ! lotteryNumbers) {
  // out of memory
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
lotteryNumbers[0] = 7;
lotteryNumbers[1] = 11;
// ...
int *resizedLotteryNumbers = realloc(lotteryNumbers, sizeof(int) * 6);
if ( ! resizedLotteryNumbers) {
  // out of memory but lotteryNumbers memory block
  // is still valid and unchanged
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
// replace the old pointer with the new one
lotteryNumbers = resizedLotteryNumbers;
lotteryNumbers[2] = 19;
// ...</pre>
    <p>
        If <code>realloc()</code> fails, it leaves the original memory block 
        unchanged. Just as for <code>calloc()</code> and <code>malloc()</code>, 
        you must remember to call <code>free()</code> on the memory block when 
        you're done with it.
    <h2>Inserting items into a C array</h2>
    <p>
        It should be obvious by now how to add items to the end of a C array 
        (if it's big enough) or a dynamically allocated memory block that 
        you've enlarged using <code>realloc()</code>. But how do you insert an 
        item at the beginning or middle of an array while keeping all of the 
        current items? There's no magic here, you have to shift items to higher 
        indices to make space for the new one.
    <pre>// insert an item at the start of a C array
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 11, 17 }; // has room for six items
// shift current items up
lotteryNumbers[2] = lotteryNumbers[1];
lotteryNumbers[1] = lotteryNumbers[0];
// array now holds { 11, 11, 17 }
lotteryNumbers[0] = 7; // insert new item
// array now holds { 7, 11, 17 }</pre>
    <p>
        Note that you need to shift items starting at the end of the array, 
        otherwise you'll overwrite items you want to preserve. Obviously 
        writing a line of code for each item you need to shift isn't a 
        practical solution. You might be tempted to use the 
        <code>memcpy()</code> function to shift items, but <code>memcpy()</code>
         has an important restriction: the source and destination memory blocks 
        may not overlap. (This is because <code>memcpy()</code> may copy items 
        front to back and thus overwrite items you want to preserve.) The 
        <code>memmove()</code> function is meant to be used when the memory 
        blocks overlap and will always shift items in the correct order to 
        preserve the contents.
    <pre>// using memmove() to insert an item
int lotteryNumbers[6] = { 11, 17 }; // has room for six items
// shift current items up
int *destination = lotteryNumbers + 1;
int *source = lotteryNumbers;
size_t size = sizeof(int) * 2;
<mark>memmove(destination, source, size);</mark>
// array now holds { 11, 11, 17 }
lotteryNumbers[0] = 7; // insert new item
// array now holds { 7, 11, 17 }</pre>
    <p>
        Because <code>memmove()</code> can operate on any kind of array or 
        memory block, we need to do some pointer arithmetic to determine the 
        source and destination addresses and the number of bytes to move. 
        Again, the <code>sizeof</code> operator helps make our intentions 
        clear. An alternate way specify the source and destination addresses is 
        to use the address of operator (<code>&amp;</code>) on indexed items in 
        the array.
    <pre>// determine source and destination using address of
// ...
int *destination = <mark>&amp;</mark>lotteryNumbers[1];
int *source = <mark>&amp;</mark>lotteryNumbers[0];
size_t size = sizeof(int) * 2;
<mark>memmove(destination, source, size);</mark>
// array now holds { 11, 11, 17 }
// ...</pre>
    <p>
        These are equivalent notations and choosing one over the other is a 
        matter of style.
    <p>
        You can use this technique to insert items into both C arrays and 
        dynamically allocated memory blocks. Just make sure that there is 
        enough space to move items around and that you don't write items past 
        the end of your array or memory. As with all things in C, there is no 
        safety net. To remove items from the beginning or middle of an array, 
        follow the same procedure using <code>memmove()</code>, only shift 
        items down and intentionally overwrite the items you want to delete. 
        I'll leave this one as an exercise for the reader ☺.
    <h2>Inserting items into an <code>NSMutableArray</code></h2>
    <p>
        While using <code>memmove()</code> to shift items around isn't 
        <em>too</em> terrible, the equivalent operations using 
        <code>NSMutableArray</code> are naturally much more direct. To insert a 
        single item at a particular index, you naturally use 
        <code>-insertObject:atIndex:</code>
    <pre>// inserting an item into an NSMutableArray
NSMutableArray *colors = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"red",
                                                          @"green",
                                                          @"blue",
                                                          nil];
[colors <mark>insertObject:</mark>@"orange" <mark>atIndex:</mark>1];
// colors now holds "red", "orange", "green" and "blue"</pre>
    <p>
        Inserting multiple items at one time is trickier. With the 
        <code>-insertObjects:atIndexes:</code> method, you can insert items 
        from an <code>NSArray</code> into your <code>NSMutableArray</code>. The 
        tricky part here is that you need to also pass in an 
        <code>NSIndexSet</code> (or <code>NSMutableIndexSet</code>) along with 
        the array. Here's how you would insert an <code>NSArray</code> 
        containing one item.
    <pre>// inserting an item into an NSMutableArray
NSMutableArray *colors = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"red",
                                                          @"green",
                                                          @"blue",
                                                          nil];
NSArray *newColors = [NSArray arrayWithObject:@"orange"];
NSIndexSet *indexSet = [NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:1];
[colors <mark>insertObjects:</mark>newColors <mark>atIndexes:</mark>indexSet];
// colors now holds "red", "orange", "green" and "blue"</pre>
    <p>
        You must make sure that there is an index in the <code>NSIndexSet</code>
         for each item you are inserting. If you want to insert the new items 
        all in one spot, the <code>+indexSetWithIndexesInRange:</code> method 
        of <code>NSIndexSet</code> makes this easy.
    <pre>// inserting multiple items into an NSMutableArray
NSMutableArray *colors = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"red",
                                                          @"green",
                                                          @"blue",
                                                          nil];
NSArray *rainbowColors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"orange",
                                                   @"yellow",
                                                   @"indigo",
                                                   @"violet",
                                                   nil];
NSIndexSet *indexSet = [NSIndexSet <mark>indexSetWithIndexesInRange:</mark>NSMakeRange(1, 4)];
[colors insertObjects:rainbowColors atIndexes:indexSet];
// colors now holds "red", "orange", "yellow", "indigo", "violet", "green" and "blue"</pre>
    <p>
        Sometimes you want to insert different items at different points in 
        your <code>NSMutableArray</code>. This is where 
        <code>-insertObjects:atIndexes:</code> really shines.  You'll want to 
        use <code>NSMutableIndexSet</code> to create the index set in this 
        case. Lets modify the previous example to insert the colors in standard 
        rainbow order.
    <pre>// inserting multiple items into an NSMutableArray
NSMutableArray *colors = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"red",
                                                          @"green",
                                                          @"blue",
                                                          nil];
NSArray *rainbowColors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"orange",
                                                   @"yellow",
                                                   @"indigo",
                                                   @"violet",
                                                   nil];
NSMutableIndexSet *indexSet = [NSMutableIndexSet indexSet];
[indexSet addIndex:1];
[indexSet addIndex:2];
[indexSet addIndex:5];
[indexSet addIndex:6];
[colors <mark>insertObjects:</mark>rainbowColors <mark>atIndexes:</mark>indexSet];
// colors now holds "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo" and "violet"</pre>
    <p>
        To figure out the correct indices can be tricky. Inside the 
        <code>-insertObjects:atIndexes:</code> method, new items will be 
        inserted one at a time, starting with the lowest index in the index 
        set. While inserting a group of items is a very powerful capability of 
        <code>NSMutableArray</code>, often times I think it's easier and faster 
        to write correct code that uses <code>-subarrayWithRange:</code> to 
        break the items up into contiguous blocks before inserting them, or 
        even to use <code>-insertObject:atIndex:</code> repeatedly to insert 
        items one by one. But when it is straightforward to figure out the 
        index set, <code>-insertObjects:atIndexes:</code> makes your code very 
        succinct.
