    <h1>Global Variables</h1>
    <p>
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/looping_in_objective-c.html>Last time</a> 
        we finished up our series on looping with a look at common uses for 
        <code>goto</code>.  Today we're starting a new series examining 
        variables in Objective-C.  Our first topic in the series is <em>global 
        variables</em>.
    <p>
        Any variable declared outside of a function or method, class 
        <code>@interface</code> or <code>struct</code> declaration is a global 
        variable:
    <pre>int count1; // global

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int count2; // local to main()
  ...
}</pre>
    <h2>Initialization</h2>
    <p>
        By default, global variables are initialized to zero.  For regular 
        pointer types (including regular C strings) this means <code>NULL</code>
         is the default value; for Objective-C object pointers, it's 
        <code>nil</code> by default.  (This is different than local variables, 
        which don't have a guaranteed initial value and thus should always be 
        explicitly initialized.)
    <p>
        A global variable can be assigned an initial value when defined, but 
        there's a tricky restriction: the initial value must be something the 
        compiler can calculate at compile time.  In general, this means you can 
        only use literal values like numbers, characters and string literals, 
        and you can only use basic numeric operators.  Here are some examples 
        of global variables with legal initial values:
    <pre>int count; // defaults to 0
int daysPerYear = 365;
int secondsPerDay = 24 * 60 * 60;</pre>
    <p>
        Unfortunately you can't call functions or methods or use other global 
        variables when assigning initial values.  Here are some examples of 
        illegal initial values for global variables:
    <pre>// WARNING: WON'T COMPILE

// ERROR: function call not allowed
size_t titleLength = strlen("Objective-C Tuesdays");

// ERROR:  method call not allowed
NSUInteger subtitleLength = [@"global variables" length];

// ERROR:  calculation uses other global variables
unsigned long totalLength = titleLength + subtitleLength;</pre>
    <p>
        This restriction generally means that global Objective-C object types 
        can't be initialized when they're declared:
    <pre>// WARNING: WON'T COMPILE
NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"one", @"two", nil];</pre>
    <p>
        There is one exception: <code>NSString</code> global variables can be 
        initialized with Objective-C string literals (those special 
        <code>@</code> strings):
    <pre>NSString *title = @"Objective-C Tuesdays";</pre>
    <p>
        If you need to do some complex initialization on your global variables, 
        your only choice is to do it explicitly when your program starts.  
        There are a few common places to do this sort of work:
    <ul>
        <li>
            at the start of <code>main()</code>
        <li>
            in your application delegate's <code>-init</code> method
        <li>
            in your application delegate's 
            <code>-applicationDidFinishLaunching:</code> method
        <li>
            in the <code>+initialize</code> method of one of your classes
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the global variable is closely associated with a particular class, 
        the <code>+initialize</code> method for that class is a good way to 
        keep related code grouped together.  Otherwise, 
        <code>-applicationDidFinishLaunching:</code> is commonly used in 
        Cocoa-touch programs while the start of <code>main()</code> is the 
        traditional place in C programs.
    <p>
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/extern_and_global_variables.html>Next 
        time</a>, we'll look at accessing global variables from multiple 
        <code>.m</code> and <code>.c</code> files.
