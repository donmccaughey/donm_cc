    <h1>Searching In Strings</h1>
    <p>
        Last week we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/slicing_and_dicing_strings.html>creating 
        substrings of C strings and <code>NSString</code>s</a>.  Today we look 
        at another common string operation: searching within a string.
    <h2>Find a character in a C string</h2>
    <p>
        As with all operations on C strings, searching requires you to deal 
        with pointers.  To find the first occurrence of a character in a C 
        string, use the <code>strchr()</code> function.  If the character is 
        found, a pointer to that character is returned.  If the character isn't 
        present in the string, <code>NULL</code> is returned.
    <pre>// find a character in a C string
char const *s = "foobar";

char const *character = strchr(s, 'b');
if (character) {
  NSLog(@"Found b");
} else {
  NSLog(@"Didn't find b");
}
// prints "Found b"</pre>
    <p>
        As we saw last week when we looked at 
        <a href=/objective-c_tuesdays/slicing_and_dicing_strings.html>substrings</a>, 
        the pointer returned by <code>strchr()</code> is effectively a 
        substring of the source string starting at the first occurrence of the 
        character you were searching for:
    <pre>char const *s = "foobar";

char const *substring = strchr(s, 'b');
if (substring) {
  NSLog(@"The substring is %s", substring);
}
// prints "The substring is bar"</pre>
    <p>
        Once you find the character you're looking for, it's common to want to 
        create a substring containing everything <em>up to</em> that position 
        in the string:
    <pre>char const *filename = "myfile.txt";

char const *dot = strchr(filename, '.');
if (dot) {
  size_t length = dot - filename;
  char *baseFilename = calloc(length + 1, sizeof(char));
  if (baseFilename) {
    str<mark>n</mark>cpy(baseFilename, filename, length);
    NSLog(@"The base filename is %s");
  }
}
// prints "The base filename is myfile"</pre>
    <p>
        You use the difference between the two string pointers to calculate the 
        number of <code>char</code>s up to (but not including) the character 
        you searched for.  After allocating a buffer to hold the new substring 
        (and the null terminator), you use the 
        <code>str<mark>n</mark>cpy()</code> function to copy the first part of 
        the source string.  Because we called <code>calloc()</code>, the last 
        <code>char</code> in our buffer is already set to zero; if you use 
        <code>malloc()</code> or a fixed buffer instead, you need to remember 
        to set the null terminator since <code>str<mark>n</mark>cpy()</code> 
        isn't guaranteed to do it for you. 
    <p>
        Very often, you want to find the <em>last</em> occurrence of a 
        character; you can use the <code>str<mark>r</mark>chr()</code> function 
        to search in reverse:
    <pre>// find a character in reverse
char const *filename = "myfile.txt";

char const *extension = str<mark>r</mark>chr(filename, '.');
if (extension) {
  NSLog(@"The extension is %s", extension);
}
// prints "The extension is .txt"</pre>
    <h2>Find one C string in another</h2>
    <p>
        To find the first occurrence of one C string in another, use the 
        <code>strstr()</code> function.  Like <code>strchr()</code>, it returns 
        a pointer to the first occurrence of the string, or <code>NULL</code> 
        if it wasn't found.
    <pre>// find one C string in another
char const *s1 = "The quick brown fox";

char const *s2 = strchr(s1, "ick");
if (s2) {
  NSLog(@"Found ick");
} else {
  NSLog(@"Didn't find ick");
}
// prints "Found ick"</pre>
    <p>
        Unfortunately the C standard library doesn't have a 
        <code>str<mark>r</mark>str()</code> function to search for the last 
        occurrence of one string in another.  You'll need to roll your own by 
        calling <code>strstr()</code> in a loop until you reach the end of the 
        string.  (The implementation of this is left as an exercise for the 
        reader, or better yet convert your C string to an <code>NSString</code> 
        and keep reading :-)
    <h2>C string encoding issues</h2>
    <p>
        The standard library functions for searching C strings work great with 
        ASCII and similar single byte encodings.  If you need to search inside 
        UTF-8 encoded C strings, you'll quickly realize that 
        <code>strchr()</code> and <code>strrchr()</code> are only useful for 
        finding the basic ASCII characters (which are also valid UTF-8 
        characters).  If you need to find non-ASCII characters like 'é', you'll 
        need to use <code>strstr()</code> to search for the byte sequence that 
        UTF-8 uses to represent it ("\xc3\xa9" for 'é').  Even then, Unicode 
        characters like 'é' can be represented two ways: as the single Unicode 
        character 'é' or as the base character 'e' followed by the combining 
        character '´'.  In general, it's better to use a C library designed to 
        deal with the encoding such as the 
        <a href=https://icu.unicode.org>International Components for Unicode</a>
         for handling UTF-8 encoded strings.  Or if you're developing for iOS 
        or Mac OS X, use <code>NSString</code> instead.
    <h2>Find one <code>NSString</code> in another</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>NSString</code> class doesn't have separate methods to search 
        for a single character or a string; you use <code>-rangeOfString:</code>
         to do either:
    <pre>// find a character in an NSString
NSString *s = @"foobar";

NSRange range = [s rangeOfString:@"b"];
if (range.location != NSNotFound) {
  NSLog(@"Found b at %u", range.location);
}
// prints "Found b at 3"</pre>
    <p>
        Searching for the last occurrence of a string is done using the related 
        method <code>-rangeOfString:options:</code> with the 
        <code>NSBackwardsSearch</code> option.
    <pre>// find last occurrence in an NSString
NSString *s = @"The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain";

NSRange range = [s rangeOfString:@"ain" options:NSBackwardsSearch];
if (range.location != NSNotFound) {
  NSLog(@"Found ain at %u", range.location);
}
// prints "Found ain at 40"</pre>
    <p>
        The options are a combination of the following bit flags: 
        <code>NSCaseInsensitiveSearch</code>, <code>NSLiteralSearch</code>, 
        <code>NSBackwardsSearch</code> and <code>NSAnchoredSearch</code>.  You 
        use the bitwise or (<code>|</code>) operator to combine them together, 
        or pass in zero for no options.
    <p>
        Use the <code>NSCaseInsensitiveSearch</code> option to find the first 
        match, ignoring the case of both strings.  The 
        <code>NSLiteralSearch</code> option is used when you want to match a 
        specific Unicode string form, such as the single character 'é' (Unicode 
        character U+00E9) and not match equivalent character sequences like 'e' 
        + '´' (Unicode characters U+0065 and U+0301).  Most applications won't 
        care about this option, but it's really handy when you need it.
    <p>
        <code>NSAnchoredSearch</code> checks for a match only at the start of 
        the string (or the end if combined with 
        <code>NSBackwardsSearch</code>).  This option is occasionally handy, 
        but the methods <code>-hasPrefix:</code> and <code>-hasSuffix:</code> 
        are easier to read equivalents.
    <pre>// anchored search
NSString *s = @"The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain";

NSRange range = [s rangeOfString:@"ain" 
                         options:NSAnchoredSearch];
if (range.location == NSNotFound) {
  NSLog(@"Doesn't start with ain");
}
// prints "Doesn't start with ain"

// same thing using -hasPrefix:
if ( ! [s hasPrefix:@"ain"]) {
  NSLog(@"Doesn't have prefix ain");
}
// prints "Doesn't have prefix ain"


// now from the end
range = [s rangeOfString:@"ain"
                 options:NSAnchoredSearch | NSBackwardsSearch];
if (range.location != NSNotFound) {
  NSLog(@"Ends with ain");
}
// prints "Ends with ain"

// same thing using -hasSuffix:
if ([s hasSuffix:@"ain"]) {
  NSLog(@"Has suffix ain");
}
// prints "Has suffix ain"</pre>
    <p>
        There are two other variations of <code>-rangeOfString:</code>.  The 
        first, <code>-rangeOfString:options:range:</code>, allows you to search 
        within a section of a larger string without having to create a 
        substring.
    <p>
        The second, <code>-rangeOfString:options:range:locale:</code>, allows 
        you to specify a locale as well as a range.  In most cases you want to 
        use the current locale, which is taken from the language setting on the 
        user's device.  The other variations of <code>-rangeOfString:</code> 
        use the current locale, and you can pass <code>nil</code> for the 
        locale to use the current one.  Sometimes you know that the string 
        contains text in a particular language, in an app that teaches German 
        for instance.  In this case you should specify a locale when searching 
        the string; the locale can affect how text is matched, especially when 
        using the <code>NSCaseInsensitiveSearch</code> option.
