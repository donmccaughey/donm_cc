        <h1>Engineering Management</h1>
        <p>
            In 2017 I became an engineering manager, a career change I wasn't
            looking for and hadn't previously considered.  My experience as
            consultant, tech lead and member of Extreme Programming teams helped
            in the transition, but there is still a lot to learn in my new role.
        <p>
            Management is a skill quite different from software engineering, and
            I still consider myself a beginner.  This page includes some of the
            things I've found useful.
