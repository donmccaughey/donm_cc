    <h1>Engineering Management</h1>
    <p>
        In 2017 I became an engineering manager, a career change I wasn't
        looking for and hadn't previously considered.  My experience as
        consultant, tech lead and member of Extreme Programming teams helped in
        the transition, but there is still a lot to learn in my new role.
    <p>
        Management is a skill quite different from software engineering, and I
        still consider myself a beginner.  This page includes some of the things
        I've found useful.
