## Project Structure

This repository consists of a number of subdirectories:
- [`gen/`](./gen/) contains a Python program that generates the overall site
- [`maze/`](./maze/) contains a maze generator in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly,
    that's used in the `/maze` page
- [`objective-c_tuesdays`](./objective-c_tuesdays/) contains a Python program
    that extracts the [_Objective-C Tuesdays_](https://donm.cc/objective-c_tuesdays/)
    posts that I wrote from the XML dump of [`blog.ablepear.com`](http://blog.ablepear.com)
    and rebuilds them as pages for this site.
- [`scripts`](./scripts/) contains build tools for the site
- [`site-src/`](./site-src/) contains site sources, including assets and
    structured content in custom `.page` files.  Some pages are generated by
    Python code in the `gen` subproject.  The `maze_bg.*` files are generated
    by the `maze` subproject and copied here.  _Objective-C Tuesdays_ pages are
    generated by the `objective-c_tuesdays` subproject and copied here.  
- [`wwwroot/`](./wwwroot/) is where all static and generated files are written
    when the `gen` program is run.  These files are then uploaded to the web
    server.
